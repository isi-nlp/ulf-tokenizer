1 @- RT-PCR and western blot analyses confirmed the strong up-regulation of serpinE2 expression and secretion by IECs expressing oncogenic MEK , Ras or BRAF .
2 @- Interestingly , serpinE2 mRNA and protein were also markedly enhanced in human CRC cells exhibiting mutation in <i> KRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i>@ .
3 @- RNAi directed against serpinE2 in caMEK @-@ transformed rat IECs or in human CRC cell lines HCT116 and LoVo markedly decreased foci formation , anchorage @-@ independent growth in soft agarose , cell migration and tumor formation in nude mice .
4 @- Treatment of CRC cell lines with U0126 markedly reduced <i> serpinE2 </i> mRNA levels , indicating that expression of <i> serpinE2 </i> is likely dependent of ERK activity .
5 @- Finally , Q-PCR analyses demonstrated that mRNA levels of serpinE2 were markedly increased in human adenomas in comparison to healthy adjacent tissues and in colorectal tumors , regardless of tumor stage and grade .
SerpinE2 is overexpressed in intestinal epithelial cells transformed by activated MEK1 and oncogenic RAS and BRAF
Among the most harmful of all genetic abnormalities that appear in CRC development are mutations of KRAS and its downstream effector BRAF as they result in abnormal ERK signaling .
In a previous report , we had shown that expression of a constitutive active mutant of MEK1 ( caMEK ) in the intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 induced morphological transformation and growth in soft agar ; in marked contrast , wtMEK overexpression had no effect on IEC-6 phenotype [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"> 3 </xref>@ ] .
In order to understand the mechanisms by which activated MEK1 induces intestinal cell tumorigenesis , the pattern of gene expression was analyzed by microarray in IEC-6 cells overexpressing activated MEK1 .
Results from microarrays comparing control ( wtMEK ) to caMEK @-@ expressing IEC-6 cells identified the <i> Serpin clade E member 2 </i> ( <i> serpinE2 </i> or <i> PN-1 </i> ) gene as a potential target of activated MEK1 .
Indeed , <i> serpinE2 </i> expression was significantly induced by more that 28 @-@ fold ( p < 0.05 ) in cells overexpressing activated MEK1 in comparison to cells expressing wtMEK ( data not shown ) .
Overexpression of <i> serpinE2 </i> in caMEK @-@ expressing IECs was furthermore confirmed following RT-PCR analysis as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref>@ .
SerpinE2 expression was also markedly enhanced in IEC-6 cells transformed by oncogenic RAS ( 26 @-@ fold ) or BRAF ( 12 @-@ fold after 12 h of 4 @-@ hydroxytamoxifen ( 4 @-@ OHT ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> ) .
Of note , the induction of serpinE2 was induced within 1 h following ERK activation as observed in cells expressing the inducible BRAF : ER fusion protein stimulated with 4 @-@ OHT ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> ) .
Treatment with the MEK @-@ inhibitor U0126 completely abrogated serpinE2 gene expression induced by oncogenic MEK1 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) and BRAF ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> ) , indicating that induction of serpinE2 is an early and direct event occurring following the activation of ERK signaling .
Since serpinE2 protein is known to be secreted [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"> 33 </xref>@ ] , we easily confirmed its presence in conditioned culture medium of caMEK @-@ expressing IECs whereas no serpinE2 protein was detected in the culture medium of wtMEK @-@ expressing or parental IECs ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> ) .
Again , treatment with the MEK @-@ inhibitor U0126 completely abrogated serpinE2 secretion ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> ) .
Interestingly , serpinE2 protein was difficult to detect in total cell lysates ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1E </xref> , lane 2 ) .
However , serpinE2 was easily observed in lysates prepared from foci of post @-@ confluent caMEK @-@ expressing cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1E </xref> , lane 4 ) , while it was not detectable in the surrounding monolayer ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1E </xref> , lane 3 ) .
This indicates a stronger expression of serpinE2 protein by the transformed IECs forming the foci .
Gene silencing of serpinE2 decreases foci formation , growth in soft agarose and migration induced by activated MEK
In order to determine the contribution of serpinE2 in intestinal transformation induced by activated MEK , foci from post @-@ confluent caMEK @-@ expressing IECs were retrieved by aspiration with a pipette and pooled as one caMEK @-@ expressing cell population .
All further experiments were performed with this previously characterized caMEK @-@ expressing IEC population [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref>@ ] and compared with wtMEK @-@ expressing cell populations .
Recombinant lentiviruses encoding anti @- @<i> serpinE2 </i> short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) were therefore developed to stably suppress serpinE2 levels in these cells .
Several lentiviral constructs were generated and tested for their ability to knock down serpinE2 protein .
One of these viral shRNAs was selected and designated as shSerpinE2 .
caMEK @-@ expressing cells were henceforth infected with shSerpinE2 lentiviruses or with lentiviruses expressing a control shRNA ( shScrambled ) .
Secretion of serpinE2 protein was analyzed 14 days after selection with blasticidin S in these populations .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , secreted serpinE2 levels were markedly reduced ( > 60 % ) in cells @-@ expressing shSerpinE2 ; in contrast , shScrambled had no effect on the secretion of serpinE2 ( data not shown ) .
To determine the functional role of serpinE2 in caMEK @-@ expressing cells , the proliferation rate of these cell populations was assessed when cultured on plastic .
No difference was observed in the proliferation rate of subconfluent caMEK @-@ expressing cells when serpinE2 expression was downregulated ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> ) .
In a previous study , we had shown that expression of activated MEK in intestinal epithelial cells resulted in loss of cell @-@ cell contact growth inhibition and produced colonies or multilayered domes which grew to increased saturation density and formed tumors when transplanted into nude mice [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref>@ ] .
Of note , focus formation assays performed herein revealed that initially , there was little difference in the number of foci obtained between control cells and serpinE2 @-@ depleted cells ( data not shown ) .
However , <i> serpinE2 </i> silencing markedly reduced the size of foci ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> ) suggesting a reduced capacity of these foci to grow .
Indeed , phase @-@ contrast microscopy revealed that the colonies were smaller when serpinE2 was downregulated ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2D </xref> ) .
Finally , expression of shSerpinE2 led to a significant decrease in the ability of caMEK @-@ expressing cells to grow under anchorage @-@ independent conditions in soft agarose ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2E </xref> ) .
Cell migration is an important process of tumorigenesis and metastasis .
Moreover , we recently reported that intestinal epithelial cells expressing activated MEK1 clearly acquire an increased capacity to migrate as compared to wtMEK @-@ expressing cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref>@ ] .
Herein , in an <i> in vitro </i> transwell migration assay , serpinE2 deficiency significantly reduced caMEK @-@ expressing IEC migration to the undersurface of the polycarbonate membrane of Boyden chambers coated with fibronectin or vitronectin ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2F </xref> ) , two extracellular matrix proteins which can interact with serpinE2 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"> 35 </xref>@ ] .
Taken together , these results support a role of serpinE2 in MEK1 @-@ induced transformation whereby serpinE2 activates anchorage @-@ independent growth and cell migration .
Expression of serpinE2 in colorectal cancer cells is dependent on MEK @/@ ERK activity
To assess the contribution of serpinE2 in human colorectal cancer , serpinE2 expression was first examined in various CRC cell lines including Caco-2 @/@ Caco-15 as well as others exhibiting mutation in <i> KRAS </i> ( HCT-116 , DLD-1 , LoVo , SW480 , T84 ) or <i> BRAF </i> ( Colo-205 , HT-29 ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"> 36 </xref>@ ] .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , <i> serpinE2 </i> mRNA levels were barely detectable in the Caco-2 @/@ Caco-15 cell line while being markedly expressed in all other CRC cell lines tested .
Two human CRC cell lines , namely HCT116 and LoVo , which have an activating mutation in the <i> KRAS </i> gene resulting in elevated MEK @/@ ERK activities [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref>@ ] , were thereby chosen to further analyze the regulation and role of serpinE2 expression in human colorectal cancer cells .
In addition , the impact of U0126 treatment was also investigated to evaluate the contribution of endogenous MEK @/@ ERK activities in serpinE2 expression in human cell models .
Forty @-@ eight @-@ hour treatment of HCT116 and LoVo cell lines with U0126 efficiently blocked endogenous MEK activity as confirmed by the marked inhibition of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation ( data not shown ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref>@ ] .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> , treatment of these CRC cell lines with U0126 markedly and significantly reduced <i> serpinE2 </i> mRNA levels , indicating that expression of <i> serpinE2 </i> is likely dependent of ERK activity in these cell lines .
Down-regulation of serpinE2 expression in human colorectal cancer cells inhibits soft agarose colony formation , migration and tumor growth in nude mice
We next investigated the effect of serpinE2 knockdown on anchorage independent growth and cell migration after downregulation of <i> serpinE2 </i> gene expression by RNA interference in HCT116 and LoVo cells .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , <i> serpinE2 </i> mRNA were significantly reduced by respectively 37 % and 88 % in LoVo cells expressing shSerpinE2 ( #15 ) or shSerpinE2 ( #16 ) and by 77 % and 92 % in HCT116 expressing shSerpinE2 ( #15 ) or shSerpinE2 ( #16 ) ; conversely , expression of the control shRNA ( shTGFP ) had no effect on endogenous <i> serpinE2 </i> expression ( data not shown ) .
Again , the proliferation rate of these cell populations was assessed when cultured on plastic .
No difference was observed in the proliferation rate of subconfluent cells when serpinE2 expression was downregulated ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
We then verified whether the reduction in <i> serpinE2 </i> expression alters the ability of colon cancer cells to form colonies in soft agarose .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> , expression of both shRNA against SerpinE2 ( #15 and #16 ) decreased the ability of HCT116 and LoVo cells to form colonies in soft agarose .
Of note , shSerpinE2 ( #15 ) which was less efficient than the shRNA ( #16 ) to reduce <i> serpinE2 </i> gene expression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) was also less efficient to reduce colony formation .
This indicates that serpinE2 controls anchorage @-@ independent growth of human colon carcinoma cells .
Additionally , as observed in caMEK @-@ expressing IECs , the size of foci formed at post @-@ confluency was significantly decreased in serpinE2 @-@ depleted LoVo cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4D </xref> ) .
The tumorigenicity of colorectal cell lines was next assessed after subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection into the flank of nude mice .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> , HCT116 and LoVo cell lines induced palpable tumors with a short latency period of respectively 15 and 10 days after their injection .
More importantly , downregulation of serpinE2 expression with shSerpinE2 ( #16 ) in these cell lines severely impaired their capacity to grow as tumors in nude mice .
Finally , <i> in vitro </i> transwell migration assays were performed to verify the importance of serpinE2 in colon carcinoma cell migration .
As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> , serpinE2 deficiency significantly reduced HCT116 ( not shown ) and LoVo cell migration to the undersurface of the membrane coated or not with fibronectin or vitronectin ( data not shown ) .
The net effect of serpinE2 knockdown was also determined on invasion by using BD Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers , in presence of hydroxyurea .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6B </xref> , the capacity of LoVo cells to invade Matrigel was also altered by serpinE2 silencing
To test the hypothesis that this altered migration and invasion capacity could result from a defect in cell adhesion , adhesion strength to the substrate was examined for control and shSerpinE2 ( #16 ) - expressing LoVo cells .
Using a trypsin @-@ mediated de @-@ adhesion assay , downregulation of serpinE2 significantly delayed LoVo cell detachment after trypsinization ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6C </xref> ) , suggesting that serpinE2 expression decreases adhesion of colorectal carcinoma cells to the substrate .
<i> SerpinE2 </i> gene expression is up-regulated in human colorectal cancers
We next analyzed <i> serpinE2 </i> gene expression in a series of human paired specimens ( resection margins and primary tumors ) by Q-PCR analysis .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7 </xref> , mRNA levels of serpinE2 were markedly increased in human adenomas in comparison to healthy adjacent tissues .
Furthermore , serpinE2 expression was also significantly enhanced in colorectal tumors , regardless of tumor stage and grade .
The average level of phosphorylation of YB-1 in the breast cancer cell lines SKBr3 , MCF-7 , HBL100 and MDA @-@ MB-231 was significantly higher than that in normal cells .
Exposure to IR and stimulation with erbB1 ligands resulted in phosphorylation of YB-1 in <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> wt </sub> SKBr3 , MCF-7 and HBL100 cells , which was shown to be K-Ras @-@ independent .
In contrast , lack of YB-1 phosphorylation after stimulation with either IR or erbB1 ligands was observed in <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> mt </sub> MDA @-@ MB-231 cells .
Similarly to MDA @-@ MB-231 cells , YB-1 became constitutively phosphorylated in <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> wt </sub> cells following the overexpression of mutated <i> K-RAS </i> , and its phosphorylation was not further enhanced by IR.
Phosphorylation of YB-1 as a result of irradiation or <i> K-RAS </i> mutation was dependent on erbB1 and its downstream pathways , PI3K and MAPK @/@ ERK .
In <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> mt </sub> cells <i> K-RAS </i> siRNA as well as YB-1 siRNA blocked repair of DNA @-@ DSB .
Likewise , YB-1 siRNA increased radiation sensitivity .
Stimulation of YB-1 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells by IR and exposure to erbB1 ligands
The level of basal YB-1 phosphorylation at S102 in a panel of breast cancer cells ( MDA @-@ MB-231 , MCF-7 , HBL100 and SKBr3 ) was compared to the level of YB-1 phosphorylation in normal cells , that is , human skin and lung fibroblasts ( HSF1 , HSF7 and HFL ) as well as normal mammary epithelial cells ( MCF-10A ) ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> ) .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> , the ratio of P-YB-1 @/@ YB-1 is significantly higher in tumor cells than in fibroblasts .
The comparisons of the ratio of P-YB-1 @/@ YB-1 in tumor cells and normal mammary epithelial cells indicated an even stronger significant difference as tested for MDA @-@ MB-231 and MCF-10A cells ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> ) .
YB-1 has been identified as a direct substrate of Akt [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"> 12 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"> 35 </xref>@ ] .
As previously reported , IR can activate the Akt ligand independently [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"> 36 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , we asked whether IR could induce YB-1 phosphorylation as well .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> , IR induces YB-1 phosphorylation differentially .
A strong phosphorylation signal was observed in SKBr3 , whereas HBL100 showed moderate phosphorylation of YB-1 and phosphorylation in MCF-7 was weak .
However , in MDA @-@ MB-231 cells , a lack of IR @-@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation was observed .
In this cell line , stimulation with the erbB1 ligand EGF , AREG or TGFα did not induce YB-1 phosphorylation , whereas strong phosphorylation at the indicated times after stimulation was observed in the cell lines SKBr3 , HBL100 and MCF-7 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> ) .
Although the MCF-7 and HBL100 cell lines have <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> wt </sub> status , these cells presented high basal YB-1 phosphorylation .
To prove whether the high basal phosphorylation status of YB-1 was due to stimulation by growth factors in the culture medium , P-YB-1 was compared under serum supplementation and serum depletion in MCF-7 cells .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1F </xref> , P-YB-1 was markedly reduced when cells were incubated in serum @-@ free medium for 24 hours .
In contrast , serum depletion did not reduce basal YB-1 phosphorylation in <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> mt </sub> MDA @-@ MB-231 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1F </xref> ) .
Constitutive phosphorylation of YB-1 in MDA @-@ MB-231 cells is K-Ras @-@ dependent
MDA @-@ MB-231 cells are characterized by a point mutation at codon 13 in the <i> K-RAS </i> gene [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref>@ ] .
This mutation is responsible for the constitutive phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref>@ ] .
In addition to ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation , these cells also present a constitutive phosphorylation of YB-1 , which is not further modified after exposure to IR or stimulation with erbB1 ligands ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1E </xref> ) .
Thus , we investigated whether the constitutive phosphorylation of YB-1 in MDA @-@ MB-231 cells is due to the described endogenous expression of mutated <i> K-RAS </i> [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , K-Ras expression was downregulated by siRNA , and the level of P-YB-1 was investigated .
Using a similar approach , we analyzed the effect of ERK1 on YB-1 phosphorylation downstream of mutated K-Ras .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , <i> K-RAS </i> siRNA led to a strong reduction in P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 and P-YB-1 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
Yet , ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and YB-1 protein levels were not affected .
Likewise , a marked reduction of P-YB-1 was observed when ERK1 was targeted with siRNA .
The role of stimulated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation on YB-1 phosphorylation was further supported by the results when a MEK inhibitor was used .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> , pretreatment of MDA @-@ MB-231 cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 markedly blocked YB-1 phosphorylation .
Similar to the data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> , exposure to IR did not induce YB-1 phosphorylation .
These results indicates that the constitutive YB-1 phosphorylation in MDA @-@ MB-231 cells is a consequence of mutated K-Ras @-@ mediated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation .
Overexpression of mutated <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> enhances basal YB-1 phosphorylation
To investigate the role of K-Ras in the constitutive phosphorylation of YB-1 , we further analyzed the status of <i> K-RAS </i> in SKBr3 , MCF-7 and HBL100 cells .
Sequencing of the <i> K-RAS </i> gene revealed that none of these cell lines presents a <i> K-RAS </i> point mutation in codon 12 , codon 13 or 61 .
To investigate whether mutated <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> could upregulate YB-1 phosphorylation , we introduced mutated <i> K-RAS </i> into <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> wt </sub> , SKBr3 and MCF-7 cells .
Cells were transiently transfected with either a control pEGFP @-@ C1 vector ( indicated as con . @-@ vector ) or a vector expressing mutated <i> K-RAS </i> , pEGFP @-@ C1/ @<i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> ( indicated as <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> ) .
Fluorescence images of living cells transfected with con . @-@ vector and <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> revealed that GFP in <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> vector @-@ transfected cells was localized to the plasma membrane , but that in con . @-@ vector @-@ transfected cells it was not ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
This is due to posttranslational modification and membrane association of K-Ras ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
In con . @-@ vector @-@ transfected cells , GFP expression was not accumulated at the cell membrane , but rather it was equally distributed throughout the cytoplasm .
The efficiency of transfection was verified by immunoblotting as well ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
In cells transfected with <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> vector , the expression of K-Ras ( 21 kDa ) resulted in a shift of GFP from 27 kDa to 48 kDa ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
The expression of GFP @-@ tagged K-Ras with a molecular weight of 48 kDa was further confirmed by stripping the anti @-@ GFP antibody from the membrane and reincubating the blots with a K-Ras antibody .
In line with our observations of MDA @-@ MB-231 cells , exogenous expression of <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> in <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> wt </sub> , SKBr3 and MCF-7 cells resulted in markedly enhanced basal phosphorylation of YB-1 at S102 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) , which prevents further enhancement of phosphorylation by IR ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3C </xref> ) .
Thus , these data support the hypothesis that in cells expressing mutated <i> K-RAS </i> , the basal phosphorylation of YB-1 is constitutively enhanced and can not be further stimulated by IR.
IR @-@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation is mediated by erbB1 @-@ dependent PI3K @/@ Akt and MAPK @/@ ERK pathways
The phosphorylation of YB-1 at S102 in response to stimulation with EGF has been described as being dependent on p90 ribosomal S6 kinase [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"> 11 </xref>@ ] .
In that study [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"> 11 </xref>@ ] , Stratford <i> et al </i>@ . showed that the stimulation of SUM149 breast cancer cells with serum , EGF and phorbol 12 @-@ myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) leads to phosphorylation of YB-1 at S102 , which is dependent on the MAP kinase pathway [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"> 11 </xref>@ ] .
Because we and others have shown that IR induces activation of erbB1 in a ligand @-@ independent manner [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] , we tested whether the IR @-@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> could be blocked by erbB1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
To test this hypothesis , the effect of the erbB1 @-@ RTK inhibitor erlotinib on YB-1 phosphorylation was analyzed in whole cell extracts as well as in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions .
Pretreatment of SKBr3 cells with erlotinib resulted in complete inhibition of YB-1 phosphorylation in whole cell extract ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) as well as in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
As expected , erlotinib also blocked basal @- and radiation @-@ induced P-Akt and P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 in these cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) .
To rule out off @-@ target effects of erlotinib , the efficacy of the highly specific erbB1 @-@ RTK inhibitor BIBX1382BS [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"> 38 </xref>@ ] on radiation @-@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation was tested in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions .
EGF was included as positive control .
As shown at the bottom of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> , in both cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions treatment with BIBX1382BS resulted in a marked reduction of YB-1 phosphorylation stimulated by IR as well as EGF treatment .
These data indicate that erbB1 @-@ RTK activity is necessary for radiation @-@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation , and this is most likely due to activation of the PI3K @/@ Akt and MAPK @/@ ERK pathways .
To test the function of PI3K @/@ Akt and MAPK @/@ ERK pathways in YB-1 phosphorylation , we further investigated whether the inhibitors of PI3K , Akt and MAPK affect YB-1 phosphorylation in irradiated cells .
The data shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4D </xref> indicate that treatment with either of the inhibitors markedly reduced the phosphorylation of YB-1 at S102 .
However , optimal inhibition was observed when cells were treated with a combination of PI3K and MEK inhibitors .
Constitutive YB-1 phosphorylation due to <i> K-RAS </i> mutation depends on erbB1 and downstream PI3K @/@ Akt and MAPK @/@ ERK pathways
As IR @-@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation was shown to be dependent on erbB1 , PI3K @/@ Akt and MAPK @/@ ERK , we further investigated whether <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> mt </sub>@ -@ dependent constitutive phosphorylation of YB-1 might be sensitive to the inhibition of erbB1 , PI3K and MEK .
To this end , <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> wt </sub> MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with con . @-@ vector or <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> vector , and 48 hours after transfection the cells were treated with the erbB1 inhibitor erlotinib , the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 2 hours .
Similar to the results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> , overexpression of <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup> resulted in an about 2.5 @-@ fold stimulation of YB-1 phosphorylation .
Erlotinib reduced mutated <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup>@ -@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation by about 50 % , while the PI3K inhibitor and the MEK inhibitor reduced <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup>@ -@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation to the control level .
However , the combination of PD98059 and LY294002 ( PD @/@ LY ) blocked basal and <i> K-RAS </i> <sup> V12 </sup>@ -@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation completely ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> ) .
These data indicate that phosphorylation of YB-1 due to mutation of <i> K-RAS </i> in part depends on activation of erbB1 .
This is most likely mediated by autocrine production of ligands and is in part independent of erbB1 , but it is dependent on activation of the PI3K @/@ Akt and MAPK @/@ ERK pathways .
Because K-Ras strongly induces YB-1 phosphorylation when it is mutated ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> ) , we next analyzed whether phosphorylation of YB-1 in <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> wt </sub> cells after irradiation or stimulation with EGF depends on K-Ras expression .
Therefore , following downregulation of K-Ras by siRNA , SKBr3 cells were irradiated or stimulated with EGF .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> , downregulation of K-Ras did not affect either IR @- or EGF @-@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation .
A lack of effect of <i> K-RAS </i>@ -@ siRNA on P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 was observed as well ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> ) .
YB-1 regulates repair of IR @-@ induced DNA @-@ DSB and postirradiation survival
In addition to its function as a transcription factor , YB-1 is also involved in DNA repair , that is , base excision repair and mismatch repair [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"> 39 </xref>@ ] .
In line with this function , it has been demonstrated that YB-1 binds to double-stranded , single-stranded and DNA @-@ containing abasic sites [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"> 40 </xref>@ ] .
So far , however , no data demonstrating the function of YB-1 in repair of IR @-@ induced DNA @-@ DSB and postirradiation survival exist .
The function of erbB1 and its downstream pathways and the impact of mutated <i> K-RAS </i> on repair of DNA @-@ DSB have been demonstrated previously [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"> 41 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"> 42 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , we next asked whether the cells presenting a differential pattern of basal @- and radiation @-@ induced YB-1 phosphorylation additionally exert a differential sensitivity to IR.
The results obtained by clonogenic assay indicate a differential response in terms of postirradiation survival of the cell lines analyzed .
The radiation dose , D @<sub> 37 </sub> , which is required to reduce cell survival to 37 % , is 1.95 Gy for SKBr3 , 1.65 Gy for MDA @-@ MB-23 , 1.35 Gy for MCF-7 and 1.10 Gy for HBL100 cells .
We further investigated whether YB-1 activity is involved in the process of DNA @-@ DSB repair and postirradiation survival .
For this purpose , a siRNA approach was used .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> , downregulation of YB-1 by siRNA , either in <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> mt </sub> MDA @-@ MB-231 or in <i> K-RAS </i> <sub> wt </sub> SKBr3 cells , resulted in impaired repair of DNA @-@ DSB as shown by enhanced residual γ-H2AX foci 24 hours after irradiation .
Interestingly , downregulating K-Ras resulted in enhanced frequency of residual DSB to the level observed with YB-1 siRNA .
Likewise , siRNA targeting of YB-1 increased radiation sensitivity tested in MDA @-@ MB-231 cells .
Primary macrophages from both naïve and lung @-@ tumor bearing mice stimulated epithelial cell proliferation .
The lungs of tumor @-@ bearing mice contained 3.5 @-@ times more IGF-1 than naïve littermates , and media conditioned by freshly isolated tumor @-@ educated macrophages contained more IGF-1 than media conditioned by naïve macrophages ; IL-4 stimulated IGF-1 production by both macrophage subsets .
The ability of macrophage conditioned media to stimulate neoplastic proliferation correlated with media IGF-1 levels , and recombinant IGF-1 alone was sufficient to induce epithelial proliferation in all cell lines evaluated .
Macrophage @-@ conditioned media and IGF-1 stimulated lung tumor cell growth in an additive manner , while EGF had no effect .
Macrophage @-@ derived factors increased p-Erk1 @/@ p-Erk2 , p-Akt and cyclin D1 levels in neoplastic cells , and the combined inhibition of both MEK and PI3K ablated macrophage @-@ mediated increases in epithelial growth .
Macrophage conditioned media profoundly stimulates the anchorage @-@ independent growth of lung tumor cells
Despite the correlation between lung macrophage content and lung tumor growth , the direct contribution of alveolar macrophages to lung tumor growth is unclear [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"> 6 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"> 7 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"> 13 </xref>@ ] .
Media conditioned by an immortalized lung macrophage cell line , MH-S , has been previously reported to stimulate the migration of lung epithelial cells harboring <i> Kras </i> mutations [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"> 18 </xref>@ ] .
To determine if MH-S conditioned media directly stimulates neoplastic growth , we first evaluated neoplastic colony formation and cell number after long-term conditioned media exposure .
In both the classic model of anchorage @-@ independent neoplastic growth on soft agar ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A-C </xref> ) , and colonization on new ultra @-@ low adherence , neutrally @-@ charged plastic ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D-F </xref> ) , macrophage @-@ conditioned media potently stimulated the proliferation of two <i> Kras </i> mutant lung tumor @-@ derived cell lines ( LM2 and JF32 ) .
Thus , macrophages secrete soluble molecules capable of greatly stimulating neoplastic colony formation and proliferation <i> in vitro </i> , which may shed light on the role of macrophage recruitment to lung cancer <i> in vivo </i>@ .
Naïve and tumor @-@ educated primary macrophage co-culture stimulates the proliferation of neoplastic and non @-@ neoplastic pulmonary epithelial cells
The relative ability of naïve vs. tumor @-@ educated alveolar macrophages to directly stimulate lung epithelial cell proliferation not been reported .
To determine if macrophages from the lungs of tumor @-@ bearing mice could directly stimulate neoplastic cell growth in a co-culture system , neoplastic LM2 cells were co-cultured with bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) macrophages ( MØ ) isolated from tumor @-@ bearing mice , and monolayer growth was assessed ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
Growth in standard tissue culture conditions measures proliferation <i> per se </i> , and not cell motility or the requirement for solid support , and permits the evaluation of non @-@ neoplastic epithelial cells which do not proliferate in anchorage @-@ independent systems .
LM2 cell number significantly increased with BAL macrophage co-culture at 48 ( 2.3 vs. 4.1 @-@ fold ) and 72 hrs ( 3.5 vs. 7.5 @-@ fold ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
As 72 hrs of macrophage co-culture resulted in ≥ 2 @-@ times more tumor cells , this time point was used in subsequent experiments .
To determine if tumor @-@ educated macrophages stimulated neoplastic growth more effectively than naïve , BAL macrophages from either naïve or tumor @-@ bearing mice were co-cultured with neoplastic LM2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> ) and JF32 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> ) cells .
LM2 growth was equally stimulated by both naïve and tumor @-@ educated BAL macrophages , while the growth of JF32 cells was enhanced slightly upon co-culture with tumor @-@ educated BAL macrophages ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> ) .
To determine if primary alveolar macrophages also stimulated the proliferation of non @-@ tumor cells , the non @-@ neoplastic E10 cell line was co-cultured with naïve and tumor @-@ educated BAL macrophages .
Both macrophage types increased E10 cell number 3.5 @-@ fold ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2D </xref> ) when maintained in serum @-@ free conditions ; only tumor @-@ educated macrophages stimulated E10 proliferation when cultured in the presence of serum ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2E </xref> ) .
Both types of primary macrophages equally stimulated LM2 proliferation in the presence of serum , though the magnitude was reduced when compared to serum @-@ free co-culture ( data not shown ) .
To determine if MH-S macrophages could recapitulate the effects of primary alveolar macrophages in this <i> in vitro </i> model , we co-cultured MH-S macrophages with both neoplastic and non @-@ neoplastic lung epithelial cells .
MH-S co-culture increased the growth rate of all pulmonary epithelial cell lines similar to co-culture with tumor @-@ educated BAL macrophages ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B-E </xref> ) .
These results indicate that primary lung macrophages produce diffusible signals which can augment the proliferation of both non @-@ neoplastic and neoplastic cells <i> in vitro </i>@ .
Further , we observed that <i> in vivo </i> tumor education of primary lung macrophages slightly enhances this ability to stimulate epithelial proliferation , an effect similar to co-culture with MH-S macrophages .
Macrophage co-culture stimulates epithelial proliferation through kinase activation
Since MH-S macrophages and tumor @-@ educated primary macrophages stimulated epithelial proliferation to a similar degree , MH-S macrophages were used to elucidate the mechanisms of increased epithelial proliferation .
Because Kras pathways are commonly hyper @-@ activated in lung tumorigenesis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref>@ ] , and the tumorigenic lines examined herein contain <i> Kras </i> mutations , activities of downstream mediators Erk and Akt were examined .
Cytosolic Raf functionally links the Erk and Akt pathways ; activated Akt can phosphorylate cRaf at S259 , placing Erk regulation downstream of Akt activation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"> 32 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"> 33 </xref>@ ] .
MH-S co-culture stimulated cRaf phosphorylation at S259 in all three cell lines , resulting in significantly higher levels of p-cRaf ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A-C </xref> ) .
The smaller ( ~ 74 kDa ) p-cRaf isoform was most highly abundant and its phosphorylation significantly increased with macrophage co-culture in the LM2 and E10 cells , but a larger ( ~ 100 kDa ) isoform was heavily phosphorylated at the expense of the 74 kDa isoform in neoplastic JF32 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
The 74 kDa isoform was the most abundant in total cRaf immunoblots from all three cell lines .
MH-S co-culture significantly increased the levels of active Erk1 @/@ Erk2 ( p-Erk ) in LM2 and JF32 cells , as well as non @-@ neoplastic E10 cells , when normalized either to total Erk ( panErk ) or β-actin levels ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A , D </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3E </xref> ) , which correlates with the observed increases in proliferation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) .
E10 cells expressed lower basal p-Erk @/@ panErk vs. the neoplastic cell lines , consistent with previous observations [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
Total Erk remained unchanged in both neoplastic cell lines , while macrophage co-culture caused Erk2 ( 42 kDa ) to nearly disappear in the E10 cells , with little effect on Erk1 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A , D </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3E </xref> ) .
Activated Akt ( p-Akt ) levels rose significantly in both neoplastic cell lines when normalized to either total Akt ( panAkt ) or β-actin , but macrophage co-culture caused both p-Akt and panAkt levels to rise to similar extents in E10 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3F </xref> ) .
When p-Akt was normalized to panAkt expression , there was no change in E10 cells with MH-S co-culture ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3F </xref> ) .
Total Akt expression increased slightly in LM2 cells but decreased in JF32 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
When normalized to β-actin , p-Akt levels significantly increased upon MH-S co-culture in all three cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3G </xref> ) .
Increased p-S473 Akt content suggests increased enzymatic activity , which can be confirmed by enhanced phosphorylation of downstream substrates .
To determine if macrophage co-culture increases Akt activity , we measured levels of p-GSK-3β , a known target of Akt [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"> 32 </xref>@ ] .
Consistent with the elevation in p-Akt , MH-S co-culture significantly increased p-GSK-3β in both LM2 and E10 cells and trended towards an increase in JF32 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3H </xref> ) ; panGSK-3β levels were unchanged ( data not shown ) .
Phospho @-@ S259 cRaf is another measure of Akt activity , and p-cRaf levels increased in all three cell lines with macrophage co-culture ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A-C </xref> ) .
Together , the observed increases in epithelial proliferation and the known roles for Erk and Akt in neoplastic lung cell division suggest that macrophage co-culture stimulates lung cell proliferation through increased Erk and Akt activity [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref>@ ] .
Combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K abrogates macrophage stimulation of neoplastic growth
Erk and Akt regulate both proliferation and resistance to apoptotic cell death , are more active in lung tumors than in normal tissue [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"> 35 </xref>@ ] , and were activated with macrophage co-culture .
Since combined MEK and PI3K inhibition slowed mutant <i> Kras @- </i>@ driven lung tumor growth <i> in vivo </i> [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] , we determined whether selective inhibition of MEK and PI3K affected macrophage @-@ stimulated proliferation in these <i> Kras </i> mutant lung tumor cell lines .
Selective inhibition of either MEK ( by U0126 ) or PI3K ( by LY294002 ) significantly decreased basal proliferation , and blocked growth stimulated by macrophage co-culture to different extents in LM2 and JF32 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> , respectively ) .
Only the combined inhibition of both kinases ablated the stimulatory effect of macrophage co-culture on neoplastic proliferation ( U0 + LY , Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref> ) .
Kinase inhibitors were applied at concentrations reported to be cytostatic and not cytotoxic [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"> 36 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref>@ ] , and none of these treatments significantly increased LM2 or JF32 cell death ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that both the MEK and PI3K pathways must be blocked to effectively inhibit macrophage @-@ stimulated neoplastic growth .
Macrophage conditioned media contains 3 @-@ 10 kDa factors which stimulate neoplastic proliferation
Macrophages produce numerous cytokines , eicosanoids and other soluble factors depending upon tissue location and environmental stimuli [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"> 18 </xref>@ ] , any number of which could be responsible for the observed neoplastic growth stimulation described above .
Media conditioned by primary BAL macrophages ( MØCM ) stimulated the proliferation of LM2 cells , albeit to a lesser extent than primary macrophage co-culture ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> " Total " vs. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> ) .
When size @-@ fractionated MØCM was added to LM2 cells , molecules between 3 and 10 kDa stimulated LM2 growth to the greatest extent ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) .
Thus , factors of this size mediated the majority of MØCM effects on LM2 growth .
Alveolar macrophages produce numerous growth factors in this size range , including IGF-1 , GM @-@ CSF and EGF [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"> 11 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"> 18 </xref>@ ] .
To further narrow down the list of possible candidates , an <i> in silico </i> analysis was performed for each fraction size as described in Materials and Methods .
The resulting data points were separately fit for each fraction size to the general equation <i> y </i> = <i> y </i> <sub> 0 </sub> + <i> a </i>@ ( 1 @- @<i> e @<sup> -@ bx </sup> </i> ) as described , with regression r @<sup> 2 </sup> = 0.997 , 0.842 and 0.918 for the > 3 , > 10 and > 30 kDa fractions , respectively .
From regression analysis , the responsible factor ( s ) appeared to be 7.23 @-@ 10.8 kDa in size , suggesting that growth factors such as IGF-1 ( 7.5 kDa ) may be responsible for the MØCM @-@ stimulated neoplastic proliferation .
Macrophage @-@ conditioned media IGF-1 levels correlate to effects on neoplastic proliferation
IGF-1 has a well @-@ established role in the metastasis of cancer cells <i> in vivo </i> , as well as stimulating growth <i> in vitro </i> [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] , and alveolar macrophages produce high levels of IGF-1 in response to quartz dust @-@ induced lung injury [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref>@ ] .
While alveolar macrophages are an important component of the chronic inflammatory milieu responsible for promoting lung tumorigenesis , IGF-1 has not been examined as a possible connection between macrophage recruitment and lung cancer progression .
BALF from tumor @-@ bearing lungs contained 3.5 @-@ times more IGF-1 than BALF from naïve mice , while EGF levels were unchanged ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
Even after normalizing to total BALF protein levels , BALF IGF-1 was significantly higher in tumor @-@ bearing animals than naïve controls ( 1.81 ± 0.33 vs. 0.95 ± 0.36 pg IGF-1 @/@ ug BALF protein , respectively , <i> P </i> < 0.01 , mean ± SD ) , suggesting that more IGF-1 is produced in the lungs of tumor @-@ bearing mice .
Measurement of IGF-1 levels in MØCM from primary naïve and tumor @-@ educated BAL macrophages showed that tumor @-@ educated macrophages produced significantly more IGF-1 than naïve macrophages ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6B </xref> , grey bars ) .
IL-4 potently stimulates alternative macrophage activation , and is more abundant in tumor @-@ bearing lungs than naïve [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"> 38 </xref>@ ] .
Alternative macrophage polarization is associated with tumorigenesis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"> 6 </xref>@ ] and increased macrophage IGF-1 production [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"> 39 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , IL-4 was added to wells containing primary naïve and tumor @-@ educated BAL macrophages to determine if alternative activation could increase IGF-1 production in either macrophage group .
Both naïve and tumor @-@ educated macrophages produced significantly more IGF-1 after IL-4 treatment ; tumor @-@ educated macrophages more than doubled IGF-1 output compared to naïve samples ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6B </xref> , green bars ) .
MH-S macrophages produced 20 @-@ times more IGF-1 than either non @-@ neoplastic or neoplastic lung cell lines , and all three cell lines produced only trace amounts ( < 2 pg @/@ mL ) of EGF ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6E </xref> ) .
In order to determine whether the growth effects of MØCM from samples generated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6B </xref> correlated with their IGF-1 content , MØCM was added to neoplastic LM2 cells .
IL-4 stimulated naïve and tumor @-@ educated MØCM significantly augmented LM2 proliferation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6C </xref> , green bars ) , with IL-4 treated tumor @-@ educated MØCM being the most potent .
MØCM from untreated tumor @-@ educated macrophages did not stimulate LM2 growth significantly more than untreated naïve MØCM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6C </xref> , grey bars ) , corresponding to previous co-culture results ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> ) .
As the growth @-@ stimulating ability of MØCM appeared to correlate to media IGF-1 levels , the levels of IGF-1 present were plotted against the fold @-@ change in LM2 cell number after MØCM addition ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6D </xref> ) .
The correlation between IGF-1 levels and neoplastic growth stimulation was highly significant ( p < 0.001 ) , indicating that MØCM IGF-1 levels were directly related to the ability of MØCM to stimulate neoplastic proliferation .
IGF-1 stimulates lung epithelial cell proliferation and is additive with MØCM
While IGF-1 levels correlated strongly with the ability of MØCM to stimulate neoplastic growth , IGF-1 induced proliferation of these non @-@ neoplastic and neoplastic mouse lung cell lines has not been demonstrated .
Recombinant mouse IGF-1 or MH-S macrophage @-@ conditioned media was sufficient to stimulate the proliferation of neoplastic LM2 , JF32 and E9 cells and non @-@ neoplastic E10 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7A-D </xref> ) .
The degree of growth stimulated by 50 ng @/@ mL IGF-1 was similar to that of MØCM in each line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7A-D </xref> ) .
These results confirm that IGF-1 alone can stimulate the growth of long @-@ established neoplastic and non @-@ neoplastic cell lines , as well as cells isolated more recently from primary mouse lung tumors ( JF32 ) , consistent with previous reports on human cancer cell lines [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] .
In order to determine any relevant role of EGFR in mediating macrophage @-@ stimulated tumor cell proliferation in these cell lines , recombinant mouse EGF was added at 2 ng @/@ mL .
This is roughly 500 @-@ times the reported EC @<sub> 50 </sub> for growth stimulation and 20 @-@ times higher than levels found in the BALF from tumor @-@ bearing animals ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
EGF had no significant effect on tumor cell proliferation when added alone , and did not significantly affect the ability of either IGF-1 or MØCM to stimulate neoplastic growth ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7E , F </xref> ) .
This is not surprising in view of recent studies showing that EGFR inhibitors do not inhibit growth of lung cells with <i> KRAS </i> mutations [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"> 40 </xref>@ ] .
As IGF-1 was sufficient to induce neoplastic proliferation , we determined whether the IGF-1 and MØCM growth effects were additive .
A dose of 50 ng @/@ ml IGF-1 stimulated neoplastic growth to a similar extent as MØCM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7A-D </xref> ) ; 2 ng @/@ mL IGF is the reported EC @<sub> 50 </sub> for IGF-1 stimulated proliferation <i> in vitro </i> as well as the concentration detected in the BALF of tumor @-@ bearing mice <i> in vivo </i> ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
IGF-1 dose @-@ dependently stimulated the proliferation of both LM2 and JF32 cells , and augmented the growth @-@ stimulating effects of MØCM when added in combination .
To determine if IGF-1R signaling mediates both IGF-1 and MØCM stimulation , lung cancer cells were pre @-@ treated with vehicle or 5 μM NVP @-@ AEW541 ( - or +, respectively ) , and cell numbers determined as indicated .
IGF-1 and MØCM each significantly increased cell numbers after 48 and 72 hrs , while pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R signaling blocked IGF-1 and MØCM growth effects in both neoplastic lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7G , H </xref> ) .
Parallel comparison of MTS values indicated a highly significant correlation between live cell numbers and relative MTS scores ( r @<sup> 2 </sup> = 0.7912 and 0.8201 for LM2 and JF32 , respectively , p < 0.0001 , data not shown ) .
Furthermore , both IGF-1 and MØCM increased the fraction of BrdU @<sup> + </sup> LM2 cells 12 @-@ 24 hrs after treatment , corresponding with significantly increased cell numbers ( data not shown ) .
These observations suggest that IGF-1 , but not EGF , plays a major role in macrophage stimulated neoplastic growth <i> in vitro </i> , consistent with the elevated IGF-1 levels observed in lung @-@ tumor bearing animals <i> in vivo </i>@ .
MØCM stimulation of neoplastic growth is diminished when IGF-1 content is decreased
In order to determine if IGF-1 was a molecular mediator directly responsible for growth stimulated by MØCM , we decreased MØCM IGF-1 content through two independent avenues : immuno @-@ depletion and siRNA interference .
MØCM was concentrated to contain ~ 3.5 ng @/@ mL IGF-1 , and then incubated with control IgG ( Con IgG ) or α-IGF-1 IgG coated resin , as described [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"> 39 </xref>@ ] .
This procedure successfully decreased MØCM IGF-1 levels to 40 @-@ 50 % of control ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8A </xref> ) .
When this IGF-1 depleted media was added to LM2 and JF32 cells , growth stimulation was significantly decreased compared to untreated MØCM or IgG controls , which were identical ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8B </xref> ) .
In addition , MH-S macrophage IGF-1 secretion was interrupted by transfection with scrambled control ( scr siRNA ) or siRNA constructs designed against mouse IGF-1 ( α-IGF siRNA ) .
One α-IGF siRNA construct was more effective than the scr siRNA , and significantly decreased MØCM IGF-1 levels to 25 % of control ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8C </xref> ) .
The scr siRNA construct decreased macrophage IGF-1 secretion to a lesser extent ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8C </xref> ) .
Transfection reagents and conditions were chosen to minimize cellular toxicity , and media IGF-1 content significantly decreased when normalized to MH-S viability ( media IGF-1 @/@ MTS relative viability , data not shown ) .
Neoplastic growth reflected the level of IGF-1 in the media conditioned by siRNA @-@ treated macrophages , with all three groups differing significantly in JF32 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8D </xref> ) .
While scr siRNA @-@ treated media did not significantly lower LM2 cell growth , the correlation of media IGF-1 levels vs. LM2 proliferation was highly significant , as in JF32 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8D-F </xref> ) .
Taken together , these experiments demonstrate that IGF-1 is responsible for the majority of neoplastic growth stimulated by MØCM .
Combined MEK and PI3K inhibition blocks IGF-1 and MØCM induced neoplastic proliferation by decreasing cyclin D1 expression
IGF-1 stimulated neoplastic proliferation and mediated a significant portion of macrophage @-@ induced tumor cell growth in culture .
To determine if MØCM and @/@ or IGF-1 were similarly blocked by MEK and PI3K inhibition , LM2 and JF32 cells were treated with combinations of MEK and @/@ or PI3K inhibitors , in the presence of IGF-1 or MØCM .
Analogous to previous results with macrophage co-culture , growth stimulated by either IGF-1 or MØCM was blocked by combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K , to a greater extent than either pathway by itself ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9A , B </xref> ) .
Consistent with the proliferation results , cyclin D1 content ( a biochemical correlate of lung cell proliferation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"> 41 </xref>@ ] ) was reduced by these inhibitors ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9C-E </xref> ) .
MØCM induced early increases in cRaf , Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation , and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation peaked at 24 hrs ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9C , D </xref> ) .
In both LM2 and JF32 cells , increased Akt phosphorylation corresponded to more phosphorylation of the Akt substrate , pGSK-3β ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9H </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9I </xref> ) .
Phospho @-@ cRaf levels , another marker of Akt activity , also increased in concert with heightened increased Akt activity from 4 @-@ 24 hrs ; although p-cRaf abruptly dropped at 48 hrs , pAkt and pGSK-3β levels remained highly elevated ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9F , H </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9I </xref> ) .
We observed reciprocal changes in the Erk and Akt pathways in response to their respective enzyme inhibitors .
In LM2 cells , MEK inhibition ( by U0126 ) suppressed early Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation while p-Akt levels increased .
Conversely , PI3K inhibition ( by LY294002 ) increased basal p-Erk1 @/@ p-Erk2 levels at the expense of p-Akt ( 4 hrs time point ; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9C </xref> ) .
MEK inhibition raised p-Erk1 @/@ p-Erk2 and total Erk1 @/@ Erk2 levels at 24 and 48 hrs , while PI3K inhibition caused a compensatory increase in cellular p-Akt levels from 24 @-@ 48 hrs .
JF32 cell growth was also suppressed by each drug ; although MEK inhibition did not affect p-Erk1 @/@ p-Erk2 levels at 4 hrs , p-Erk1 @/@ p-Erk2 levels decreased at 48 hrs ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9D </xref> ) .
PI3K inhibition stimulated Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation from 4 @-@ 24 hrs , and increased Akt phosphorylation throughout the treatment time @-@ course ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9G , H </xref> ) .
While each inhibitor decreased basal proliferation rates ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9A , B </xref> ) , combinations of kinase inhibitors and MØCM increased cRaf , Erk1 @/@ Erk2 , Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation in an additive manner , with the highest levels observed in cells treated with both kinase inhibitors and MØCM ( " U+L + " , Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9C-I </xref> ) .
Total and p-cRaf , p-Akt and p-GSK-3β were each significantly higher after 4 @-@ 24 hrs of treatment in all groups receiving any combination of drug and MØCM , and p-Erk1 @/@ p-Erk2 levels spiked after 24 hrs of treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9F-I </xref> ) .
Either inhibitor alone partially prevented the increase in cyclin D1 in cells treated with MØCM ; cells receiving both inhibitors had the lowest cyclin D1 levels and were unresponsive to MØCM @-@ induced growth ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9E </xref> ) .
Taken together , MØCM @-@ induced neoplastic Akt and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation was magnified several @-@ fold by inhibitor treatment , dissociating kinase activity from proliferation in drug @-@ treated cells ; however , cyclin D1 levels were suppressed by either drug alone , which corresponded to decreased cell proliferation .
As with MØCM , IGF-1 stimulated both Akt and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 activities .
Kinase activation was greatest within 4 hrs of treatment , and remained elevated 48 hrs later , corresponding with increased cyclin D1 expression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10"> 10A-E </xref> ) .
When treated with 2 ng @/@ mL EGF , a concentration 1,000 @-@ times higher than the amount of EGF in cell @-@ conditioned media and 40 @-@ times higher than what is detected in BAL fluid , Erk1 @/@ Erk2 activity was not significantly elevated and Akt levels were unaffected ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10"> 10C , D </xref> ) .
EGF may partially stimulate Erk1 @/@ Erk2 activity at supra @-@ physiological levels , but this was not sufficient to stimulate cellular growth .
When administered at cell @-@ and tissue @-@ relevant levels , IGF-1 stimulated both Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt activation , elevated cellular cyclin D1 content , and induced neoplastic proliferation .
Evidence presented here indicate that BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> significantly induces cell migration and invasion properties <i> in vitro </i> in colon cancer cells , at least in part through activation of RhoA GTPase .
The relationship established between BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> and RhoA activation is mediated by the MEK @-@ ERK pathway .
In parallel , KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> enhances the ability of colon adenocarcinoma cells Caco-2 to migrate and invade through filopodia formation and PI3K @-@ dependent Cdc42 activation .
Ultimately increased cell migration and invasion , mediated by Rac1 , along with the mesenchymal morphology obtained through the Epithelial @-@ Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) were the main characteristics rendered by HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> in Caco-2 cells .
Moreover , BRAF and KRAS oncogenes are shown to cooperate with the TGFβ-1 pathway to provide cells with additional transforming properties .
BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> induces distinct morphological changes in colon adenocarcinoma cells as compared to KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> and loss of their epithelial architecture in 3D culture
Previously established Caco-BR cells have adopted a substantially different morphology when compared to the parental Caco-2 cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
The elongated morphology acquired by Caco-BR cells was characterized by long membrane protrusions ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> , Additional Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> ) .
We present evidence that the morphology of Caco-BR13 cells show properties of both Caco-2 epithelial nature and of the mesenchymal phenotype of Caco-H2 cells .
On the other hand , Caco-K15 cells , which overexpress KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> , have retained the overall parental morphology of Caco-2 cells .
For comparison , established adenocarcinoma cell lines HT29 and DLD-1 , bearing mutant <i> BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> </i> and <i> KRAS @<sup> G13D </sup> </i> respectively , have also been analyzed in the present study .
It is of interest that the phenotype of Caco-BR cells resembles that of DLD-1 cells ( KRAS @<sup> G13D </sup> ) , especially since both of these cell types share high levels of p-BRAF ( later analyzed ) .
Our previous study shows important similarities between Caco-BR and DLD-1 cells regarding their tumourigenic properties and signaling pathways , suggesting that their transformation process occurs mainly through the constitutive activation of the MAPK ( Mitogen @-@ Activated Protein Kinase ) pathway [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
Staining with phalloidin resolved the morphological differences within the cell line panel indicating major actin cytoskeleton changes ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) .
More specifically , in Caco-BR13 cells the formation of stress fibers was enhanced , whereas formation of filopodia @-@ membrane protrusions enriched with actin @- is evident in Caco-K15 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A-ii </xref> , arrow ) .
In order to study in depth the morphology and architecture of the different cell lines under conditions that resemble the real tissue microenvironment , the three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) culture system was adopted .
As also previously shown [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref>@ ] , Caco-2 cells were organized into cyst @-@ like structures that resemble normal colon cell architecture following their growth in Matrigel for about 12 days ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> ) .
In contrast , Caco-H cells ( EMT model ) formed invasive masses with elongated protrusions , an architecture not shared by Caco-BR13 and Caco-K15 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> , upper panel , black arrow ) .
During 3D culture conditions , normal epithelial cells are organized into spheroids presenting a characteristic centrally @-@ localized hollow lumen and distinct polarization of cells surrounding this lumen .
Epithelial cancer cells do not form such structures ; instead they develop non @-@ polarized clusters with limited differentiation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
Following staining with Hoechst and phalloidin the ability of Caco-2 cells to form spheroids with lumen was observed , a property also retained by Caco-K15 cells but completely absent in Caco-BR13 and Caco-H2 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> , lower panel ) .
Significantly enlarged and more compact spheroids without lumen were formed by Caco-BR13 cells as compared to Caco-2 cells .
In the case of Caco-H2 cells , no typical spheroids were formed , instead large masses with non @-@ canonical shape were observed , typical of cancer cells .
Therefore , under 2D as well as 3D culture conditions BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> overexpression managed to alter the morphology of colon adenocarcinoma cells , rendering them a more mesenchymal @-@ like phenotype , while KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> conserved the epithelial architecture of Caco-2 cells in general .
BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> downregulates E-cadherin at the mRNA level and impairs its distribution in human colon adenocarcinoma cells
It has been previously shown that HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> converts Caco-2 epithelial into mesenchymal cells by inducing loss of E-cadherin and overexpression of vimentin [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] .
In order to examine whether BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> had a similar effect on Caco-2 cells , the expression and localization of E-cadherin was analyzed ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A , B </xref> ) .
Transformation of Caco-2 cells with BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> led to a significant decrease in the mRNA levels of E-cadherin but had no significant effect on the actual protein expression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
Notably , in Caco-BR cells reduced intensity for E-cadherin was observed mostly in lower molecular weight protein bands representing the mature protein at 120 kDa ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref>@ -@ lower panel , high exposure ) , whereas the decrease in the actual precursors at 135 kDa ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref>@ -@ lower panel , low exposure ) , is considerably less .
It appears that mutant BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> but not upstream KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> activation is able to suppress the mature E-cadherin , while the precursor remained mostly unaffected .
Nevertheless , immunostaining with E-cadherin revealed a significant impairment of its distribution at the cell @-@ cell boundaries since staining appeared discontinuous at the adherent junctions ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> , upper panel magnification ) .
Expression of E-cadherin in the Caco-BR grown in 3D spheroids was found significantly downregulated with diffused distribution ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> , lower panel ) .
In contrast , the epithelial marker E-cadherin was normally localized at the cell @-@ cell junctions of Caco-2 and Caco-K15 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> , lower panel magnification ) .
In order to determine whether Caco-BR cells have acquired more mesenchymal characteristics , RNA and protein levels of the mesenchymal marker Vimentin were examined ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> ) .
An increase of about 3 @-@ fold was observed at the protein level , while confocal images did not show significant difference , as compared to Caco-2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2D </xref> ) , since it is known that some cancer epithelial cells abnormally express N-cadherin which has been shown to promote motility and invasion [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] , N-cadherin expression was examined ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2E </xref> ) .
In Caco-BR cells N-cadherin expression is increased about 2 @-@ fold both at mRNA and protein levels , as compared to Caco-2 cells .
Confocal images confirmed this increase , as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2F </xref>@ .
Taken together these data suggest that BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> overexpression failed to induce an integrated EMT phenotype , which is the case with HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> overexpression [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] , but managed to transform Caco-2 cells through the loss of some important epithelial characteristics .
Differential BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> , KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> and HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> effect on the migration and invasion ability of Caco-2 cells <i> in vitro </i>
To further explore oncogenic effects on the cell cytoskeleton with regard to oncogenic transformation , the invasive and migratory properties of the previously established oncogenic cell models and in colon cancer cell lines HT29 and DLD-1 were analyzed .
Transformation induced by each of the three oncogenes <i> KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> </i> ( Caco-K cells ) , <i> BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> </i> ( Caco-BR cells ) and <i> HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> </i> ( Caco-H cells ) managed to increase the ability of Caco-2 cells to migrate and invade <i> in vitro </i> , independently of their proliferating ability , which has been previously analyzed in [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
More specifically , <i> BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> </i> and <i> HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> </i> provided Caco-2 cells with highly migrating and invasive properties , some similar to those in DLD-1 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A , B </xref> ) , which is compatible with their more elongated morphology described earlier ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Moreover , Caco-K cells , that retained typical epithelial morphology of Caco-2 parental cells also presented enhanced migrating and invasive properties , but to a lesser extent .
Taken together , morphological properties induced by either <i> BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> </i> or <i> KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> </i> oncogene affected the ability of Caco-2 cells to migrate and invade <i> in vitro </i> , but were not sufficient to fully reverse their epithelial phenotype .
The role of <i> BRAF </i> and <i> KRAS </i> oncogenes in altering cytoskeletal properties was further emphasized following depletion of BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> by shRNA in HT29 cells , where migration ability of HT @-@ ShBR3 cells , with downregulated expression of mt @<i> BRAF </i> gene , was significantly impaired as compared to the empty vector control HT @-@ ps cells .
Likewise , knock out of KRAS @<sup> G13D </sup> in DLD-1 cells ( DKO-4 ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref>@ ] significantly reverted the migration ability of DLD-1 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3C </xref> ) .
BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> enhances the ability of Caco-2 cells to migrate and invade <i> in vitro </i> through RhoA activation
Overexpression of BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> in Caco-2 cells had a profound effect on the RAS effector protein RhoA ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref> ) .
In Caco-BR cells activation of RhoA is increased ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) as well as phosphorylation of its downstream target Cofilin , a protein that is related to stress fibre formation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
These findings are closely related to the observation regarding increased stress fibre formation indicated by phalloidin staining in Caco-BR13 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Notably , an extra band of lower molecular weight is detected for RhoA in Caco-BR and DLD-1 cells , which potentially represents the main active GTPase form ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) .
A variant of lower molecular weight for RhoA protein has previously been reported both in colon and breast tissues [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"> 7 </xref>@ ] .
However , RT-PCR analysis and treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 , both in Caco-BR and DLD-1 cells , suggested no association of this faster migrating RhoA band with alternative splicing or proteasomal degradation ( data not shown ) .
These data suggested that the additional band potentially represents a post @-@ translational modification of RhoA protein .
To further explore the role of BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> in the activation of the RhoA pathway , transient transfection of the oncogene in Caco-2 cells was performed ( Additional Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref> ) .
Subsequent analysis of the migration and invasion properties showed that moderate RhoA activation induced a partial cell migration and cell invasion response ( Addition Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2A , B </xref> ) .
Notably in the invasion assay cell phenotype became slightly altered and resembled that of the stable Caco-BR clones ( Additional Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2C </xref> ) , suggesting that a stable expression of BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> is required to achieve complete cell transformation and extensive RhoA activation .
Regarding the importance of RhoA activation in the induced cell migration and invasion observed in Caco-BR cells , siRNA against RhoA was performed leading to significant protein depletion in both Caco-2 and Caco-BR13 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> ) .
Depletion of RhoA substantially impaired both acquired properties with more profound effect in Caco-BR13 cells , further illustrating its central role in the BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> oncogene @-@ induced transformation of colon adenocarcinoma cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> ) .
Moreover , following RhoA depletion in Caco-2 cells , the number and size of stress fibres were notably reduced as compared to Caco-BR cells , where no such alteration was observed ( data not shown ) .
In order to study further the impact of RhoA GTPase on cell migration , silencing of RhoA was performed in DLD-1 and HT29 cells .
Considering that these cell lines bear mutation in KRAS @<sup> G13D </sup> and BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> respectively , RhoA depletion was also performed in selected clones where KRAS @<sup> G13D </sup> ( DKO4 ) or BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> ( HTshBR3 ) was knocked out or down regulated via shRNA respectively .
This approach can implement the connection between each oncogene and the small GTPase .
After silencing of RhoA , cell migration was significantly reduced in DLD-1 , while no reduction was observed in DKO4 cells , where mutant KRAS @<sup> G13D </sup> is knocked out , ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5C </xref> ) .
Depletion of RhoA in HTshBR3 ( transfected with shRNA pSUPER BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> ) cells with suppressed BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> activity did not reverse the ability of HT29 cell to migrate , while in HTps ( HT29 cells transfected with empty vector pSUPER ) a moderate reduction in cell migration was observed ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5D </xref> ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that both <i> BRAF </i> and <i> KRAS </i> oncogenes utilize RhoA activation to promote cell migration .
In a different approach , inhibition of RhoA downstream signalling was achieved via treatment of cells with UO126 , a MEK ( mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase @/@ extracellular signal @-@ regulated kinase kinase ) inhibitor targeting the MAPK pathway , which is active in Caco-BR cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
Treatment with UO126 , at the most optimal treatment condition ( Additional Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> ) , resulted in the decreased activation of RhoA illustrating that mutant BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> utilises the MAPK pathway to activate RhoA ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5E </xref> , upper panel ) .
Alternative regulation of RhoA through the PI3K pathway was analysed in Caco-BR cells , and a mild effect on RhoA downstream components like p-Cofilin and p-Myl was observed ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5E </xref> , lower panel ) .
Analysis of RhoA @-@ ROCK axis
Since RhoA appears to be essential for the attained migration in Caco-BR13 cells , RhoA @-@ Rho kinase signalling was inhibited using the selective ROCK ( Rho @-@ associated coiled coil forming protein serine @/@ threonine kinase ) inhibitor Y-27632 aiming to inhibit cell migration .
Treatment of Caco-2 and Caco-BR13 cells with the ROCK inhibitor had a moderate effect on downstream target p-Cofilin , while cell motility was found significantly increased in both cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A-B </xref> ) .
To exclude the possibility of this observation being the non @-@ specific effect of the inhibitor targeting several other kinases , siRNA against both ROCK isoforms ( ROCK1 and ROCK2 ) was applied to both Caco-BR clones and parental Caco-2 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6C </xref> ) .
Besides , the use of siRNA to deplete a protein and especially a small GTPase can prove more promising since the specific protein sequence is targeted .
In several reported studies , treatment with a selective inhibitor may produce more adverse effect through interaction with other ( associated ) components .
Regardless efficient ROCK depletion , no inhibition in cell migration or invasion was observed in BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> transformed cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6D </xref> ) .
Nevertheless increase motility was recorded in Caco-2 cells suggesting that Rac1 activation may be taking a lead role in the absence of the RhoA @-@ Rho kinase signalling .
KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> induces Cdc42 @-@ dependent migration ability and filopodia formation in Caco-2 cells , partially dependent on PI3K pathway
Previous studies have indicated that RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 signalling is essential for oncogenic Ras transforming capacity [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"> 29 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref>@ ] .
In the present study , Caco-2 cells overexpressing mutant KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> ( Caco-K ) , selective activation for Cdc42 was detected ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7A </xref> ) .
The formation of filopodia in these cells , earlier described , was in agreement with the high Cdc42 activity and is illustrated here by staining with antibody against Fascin , a filopodia marker ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7B </xref> , upper panel ) .
A large number of relatively short filopodia distributed almost exclusively at the cell periphery was evident in Caco-K cells , while Caco-BR and Caco-H cells formed less but longer structures with a rather polarized shape potentially pointing towards the direction of cell migration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7B </xref> , upper panel ) .
Nevertheless , no changes in Fascin protein expression were recorded in the different cell lines , ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7B </xref> , lower panel ) .
Increased migration ability in Caco-BR and Caco-H cells may be indicative for the length and the location of filopodia .
It has been previously shown that in CHO-K1 cells ( Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast @- like cells ) RhoA expression down-regulates Cdc42 and Rac1 activity in order to regulate membrane protrusions and cell polarity .
In addition , Rac1 activity may down-regulate Cdc42 activity and promote the formation of stabilized rather than transient protrusions [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"> 31 </xref>@ ] .
Indeed , low Cdc42 activity was recorded in Caco-BR and Caco-H cells where RhoA signaling is activated .
To explore the role of Cdc42 in mutant KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> induced cell transformation , Caco-2 and Caco-K15 cells were treated with siRNA against this small GTPase .
Significant downregulation of Cdc42 at the protein level was observed in both cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7C </xref>@ -@ upper panel ) , that caused a significant decrease of cell migration and invasion ability of Caco-K15 and of Caco-2 cells but to a lesser extent ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7C </xref>@ -@ lower panel ) .
Depletion of Cdc42 also affected the filopodia formation , when Caco-K cells were treated with siRNA against Cdc42 acquired rounded cell membrane lacking filapodia protrusion suggesting that filopodia formation in Caco-K cells is Cdc42 @-@ dependent ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7D </xref> ) .
These findings suggest that KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> regulates motility and invasiveness of colon cancer cells through the Cdc42 GTPase .
Considering that the PI3K pathway is also a KRAS effector pathway , the possibility of a cross @-@ talk between the PI3K signalling pathway and Cdc42 was explored [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
Following treatment with wortmanin at the most optimal treatment condition , as retrieved from inhibition of the active PI3K pathway in Caco-H2 cells that show high p-AKT levels ( Additional Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4"> 4 </xref> ) , resulted in reduced Cdc42 activity .
This illustrates how Cdc42 activation in response to the KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup>@ -@ PI3K signalling pathway can be potentially essential for Cdc42 @-@ dependent cell migration and invasion properties ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7E </xref> ) .
HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> induces high cell migration and invasion properties mediated by Rac1 associated with acquired EMT
Activation of Rac1 , another RAS effector protein , was found slightly increased in Caco-H2 cells with EMT characteristics [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8A </xref> ) .
Activation of Rac1 in Caco-H2 cells is in agreement with previous studies that correlate Rac1 with EMT and the inhibition of E-cadherin in mammary epithelial and pancreatic carcinoma cells respectively [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"> 32 </xref>@ ] .
In contrast , a weak effect on Rac1 GTPase was recorded in Caco-BR cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8A </xref> ) and could be explained by the known antagonistic effect that exists between RhoA and Rac1 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"> 33 </xref>@ ] .
As described earlier , HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup>@ -@ transfected Caco-2 cells ( Caco-H2 ) have undergone EMT , followed by the dramatic reduction of E-cadherin expression [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref>@ ] .
Following PI3K pathway depletion using the specific inhibitor wortmanin at the most optimal treatment condition ( Additional Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4"> 4 </xref> ) , Rac1 activity was successfully inhibited only in Caco-2 cells , leaving Caco-H2 cells unaffected ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8B </xref> , upper panel ) .
Notably , under the same treatment conditions RhoA activity was found to be slightly increased , suggesting an involvement of the PI3K pathway in RhoA regulation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8B </xref> , lower panel ) .
It is therefore concluded that in Caco-H2 cells , HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> deregulates PI3K @-@ dependent activation of Rac1 as well as mediates RhoA inhibition .
To further explore the involvement of Rac1 activation in the transforming ability of HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> in Caco-2 cells , pharmacological inhibition of Rac1 was established using the selective inhibitor NSC23766 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8C </xref> ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref>@ ] .
Inhibition of Rac1 not only managed to suppress Rac1 activation but also to abolish cell migration and invasion properties in a dose dependent manner ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8D </xref> ) , indicating the critical role of Rac1 in EMT cell properties of Caco-H cells .
TGFβ-1 co-operates with <i> BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> </i> and <i> KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> </i> oncogenes to provide Caco-2 cells with enhanced transformation properties
Since <i> BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> </i> and <i> KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> </i> oncogenes did not manage to fully transform Caco-2 cells nor induced an EMT phenotype , as <i> HRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> </i> did , it was further investigated whether co-operation of oncogene @-@ growth factor can produce synergistic effect .
The previously established oncogenic models of BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> and KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> along with the parental Caco-2 cells were treated with Transforming Growth Factor beta-1 ( TGFβ-1 ) for 14 days .
Staining with phalloidin revealed significant morphological changes in TGFβ-1 treated Caco-K15 cells that were not observed in Caco-2 cells following treatment with TGFβ-1 , while no morphological changes were recorded in TGFβ-1 treated Caco-BR13 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9A </xref> ) .
Protein analysis for E-cadherin , in fractionized soluble ( intracellular ) and insoluble ( bound @-@ membrane E-cadherin ) extracts indicated a reduction of E-cadherin in the insoluble fraction in Caco-2 and Caco-K15 cells to a greater extend ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9B </xref> , upper panel ) .
Interestingly , even though levels of E-cadherin were not altered in Caco-BR13 cells , confocal images clearly presented disrupted cell @-@ cell contacts and discontinuous staining which weakens cell junctions allowing cell migration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9B </xref> , lower panel @-@ arrows ) .
Altered localization of E-cadherin is an important mechanism contributing to cell metastasis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"> 35 </xref>@ ] .
TGFβ-1 was also investigated for its potential effect on cell migration and invasion .
Treatment with TGFβ-1 increased the capacity of Caco-BR13 cells to invade <i> in vitro </i> , while no effect in the migrating ability of these cells was recorded ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9C </xref> ) .
This enhanced invasive capacity of Caco-BR13 cells is independent of their cell proliferation ( Additional Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5"> 5 </xref> ) .
In contrast , cell migration and invasion of Caco-2 and Caco-K15 cells were not affected by TGFβ-1 treatment , although KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup>@ -@ transfected cells acquired a more elongated morphology and slightly downregulated E-cadherin .
Taken together , these results suggest that TGFβ-1 can synergise with KRAS @<sup> G12V </sup> and BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> oncogenes to provide Caco-2 cells with a more transforming phenotype .
According to previous studies , the mutation in the C-terminal domain of Smad4 , D351H , that is present in Caco-2 cells , results in complete Smad4 inactivation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"> 36 </xref>@ ] .
However , TGFβ-1 has been shown to act through alternative non @-@ Smad pathways , such as Rho GTPases and MAPK [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"> 39 </xref>@ ] .
Indeed , following TGFβ-1 treatment , enhanced activity for RhoA GTPase as well as pERK1 @/@ pERK2 was recorded in Caco-2 , Caco-K15 and Caco-BR13 cells .
Based on these observations other than non @-@ Smad signaling like RhoA GTPase and pERK1 @/@ pERK2 pathways can be regulated by TGF-beta , to induce the morphological changes observed in the Caco-2 transformed and parental cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9"> 9D </xref> ) .
Combined treatment of selumetinib and standard of care agents results in enhanced anti @-@ tumour efficacy
Mechanistic biomarker studies of the effects of selumetinib in human tumour xenograft models have shown that , in addition to pERK1 @/@ pERK2 downregulation , a sustained exposure to the agent results in an increase in downstream apoptotic signalling and a decrease in cell cycle progression ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"> Davies <i> et al </i> , 2007 </xref> ) .
Furthermore , a chronic dosing schedule of selumetinib ( 25 mg kg @<sup> –1 </sup> per bid for 14 doses ) in HCT-116 xenografts increased the levels of the pro @-@ apoptotic BH3 protein Bim @-@ EL ( ∼4 @-@ fold increase ) compared with no change with the level of this protein following a shorter dosing period ( three doses ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1 </xref> ) .
In order to exploit the apoptotic threshold of selumetinib , we wanted to study the effects of combining it with agents known to induce the apoptotic cascade to drive tumour growth inhibition and @/@ or cell death .
The effects of selumetinib in combination with a number of key standard of care agents were tested pre @-@ clinically in human tumour xenograft models and resulted in enhanced anti @-@ tumour activity .
A number of compounds including the DNA @-@ alkylating agent TMZ and the anti @-@ mitotic drug docetaxel resulted in a greatly enhanced tumour growth inhibition compared with monotherapies ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> supplementary Table 1 </xref> ) .
However , combining selumetinib with gemcitabine did not enhance the anti @-@ tumour activity of the individual agents ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> supplementary Table 1 </xref> ) .
The data presented here suggests that when selumetinib is combined , with either TMZ or docetaxel , the resulting anti @-@ tumour phenotypes maybe due to mechanistic interactions between the two compounds .
Selumetinib in combination with TMZ enhances DNA damage
The combination of selumetinib and TMZ in the SW-620 human tumour xenograft model resulted in a significantly enhanced anti @-@ tumour efficacy ( 103.5 % inhibition ; <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) , compared with selumetinib ( 52 % inhibition ; <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) and TMZ ( 88 % inhibition ; <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) alone ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2A </xref> ) .
At the end of the dosing period , the monotherapy and combination treatment groups were left to observe the growth rate following the cessation of dosing ( animals in the control group had to be killed due to tumour size ) .
In the selumetinib and TMZ monotherapy @-@ treated groups , tumour growth progressed rapidly once compound treatment had been removed .
In contrast , the start of tumour growth in the combination group was delayed for approximately 24 days from the start of the experiment compared with 15 days in the TMZ alone group .
In order to investigate potential mechanisms , to explain the enhanced combination effect with TMZ , we used the growth inhibition data generated from our anti @-@ tumour studies to guide our pharmacodynamic sampling times ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2A </xref> ) .
Samples were collected at the end of the TMZ dosing ( PD1 ) , when the TMZ and combination groups growth rate started to diverge ( PD2 ) , at the end of selumetinib dosing ( PD3 ) and at the end of the re @-@ growth period ( PD4 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2A </xref> ; white arrows on graph ) .
IHC analysis and histological scoring was performed on all the tissues collected to examine , selumetinib effects ( pERK1 @/@ pERK2 ) , DNA damage ( <i> γ </i>@ H2A.X ) , apoptosis ( cleaved caspase 3 ) and the cell cycle ( pHH3 ) ( scoring data not shown ) .
The sampling timepoint , which gave us the greatest insight into the mechanistic effects of these agents was that taken when we started to see the TMZ and combination groups diverge ( PD2 ) .
As expected , in response to selumetinib or TMZ alone we saw changes in the mechanistic biomarkers pERK1 @/@ pERK2 ( decrease ) and <i> γ </i>@ H2A.X ( increase ) , respectively , and a reduction in mitotic cells as shown by pHH3 in the selumetinib group compared with an increase in the TMZ tissues ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2B </xref> ) .
Level of the apoptotic marker , cleaved caspase 3 , was comparable in the combination group compared with the TMZ monotherapy ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2B </xref> ) .
However , in the combination group we observed a greatly enhanced upregulation of <i> γ </i>@ H2A.X compared with the TMZ group alone , suggesting that when selumetinib and TMZ are combined DNA damage is enhanced ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2B </xref> ) .
Selumetinib is efficacious in combination with docetaxel when dosed concurrently or following docetaxel
Continuous , concurrent combinations of selumetinib and docetaxel resulted in significant anti @-@ tumour effects in several models ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
However , we were interested to explore the effect of dose sequencing on the anti @-@ tumour efficacy of these two agents as administration of selumetinib and docetaxel as monotherapies results in distinct cell cycle phenotypes ; a G1 or mitotic arrest , respectively .
Two schedules were designed in which mice bearing HCT-116 CRC tumours were treated with either a single dose of docetaxel ( 15 mg kg @<sup> –1 </sup> ) followed 24 h later by selumetinib ( 25 mg kg @<sup> –1 </sup> per bid ) for 7 days ( schedule 1 ) or selumetinib was administered as above for 7 days followed 24 h later with docetaxel ( schedule 2 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3B </xref> ) .
As monotherapies , docetaxel and selumetinib resulted in 77 % ( <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) and 50 % ( <i> P </i> < 0.005 ) tumour growth inhibition , respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3C </xref> ) .
Interestingly , in the two combination schedules docetaxel administered before selumetinib ( schedule 1 ) resulted in a 110 % ( <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) compared with 61 % ( <i> P </i> < 0.005 ) tumour growth inhibition when docetaxel was administered after selumetinib ( schedule 2 ) .
These results suggest that selumetinib could enhance the efficacy of docetaxel when administered in the sequence of docetaxel followed by selumetinib .
The sequence dependency of selumetinib when combined with docetaxel enhances apoptotic cell death
In order to determine the mechanism of action in the scheduling studies with docetaxel , a series of tumour tissue samples were taken at different time points following exposure to the two dosing regimens ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4Ai and Bi </xref> ) .
To assess the cell cycle mechanistic effects the mitotic marker pHH3 was quantitated .
In the sequence when docetaxel was administered before selumetinib , increased levels of pHH3 were observed at the early timepoints ( PD1 & PD2 ) ( 2.7 @- and 2.3 @-@ fold change , respectively ; <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) .
In schedule 2 , pHH3 levels were seen to increase following docetaxel ( PD7 ) ( 3.4 @-@ fold ; <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4Aii and 4Bii </xref> ) .
When selumetinib was administered alone levels of pHH3 decreased at several measurement points compared with controls ( PD2 <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ; PD4 <i> P </i> < 0.005 ; PD5 <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ; PD6 <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) consistent with the inhibition of the MEK @/@ ERK pathway resulting in a G1 @/@ S arrest .
Interestingly , in both sequences in the combination there is a reduction in pHH3 compared with the docetaxel alone group at that timepoint ( PD2 and PD7 ) ( 3.8 @- and 2.5 @-@ fold change , respectively ; <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) .
Levels of the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase 3 , in tumour tissue taken from the docetaxel followed by selumetinib group , increased in this combination group ( 16.8 @-@ fold change from the control ; <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) compared with the single agents alone ( 3.5 @- and 2.4 @-@ fold change for docetaxel and selumetinib , respectively ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4Aiii </xref> PD2 ) .
In comparison , tumour tissue analysed in the same study after the chronic dosing schedule of selumetinib did not demonstrate an increase in cleaved caspase 3 levels in the combination group when compared with the single agents alone .
When selumetinib was dosed before docetaxel an increase in cleaved caspase 3 was not observed in the combination group at any of the sampling timepoints compared with at least one of the monotherapies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4Biii </xref> ) .
Representative IHC images from PD2 highlights the increase in pHH3 following docetaxel exposure and the increase in cleaved caspase 3 in the docetaxel followed by selumetinib group ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4C </xref> ) .
The data presented here suggests that the combination efficacy effect seen when docetaxel was dosed before selumetinib was due to an increase in apoptosis .
Sequence scheduling of selumetinib and the Aurora B kinase inhibitor , barasertib ( AZD1152 ) , results in tumour regression and increased cell death
The dose @-@ scheduling effects of combining selumetinib and docetaxel lead us to investigate the sequence dependency of selumetinib combined with another mitotic targeting agent , the Aurora B kinase inhibitor , barasertib ( AZD1152 ) ( 16 ) .
We designed two regimes in which barasertib was dosed at 150 mg kg @<sup> –1 </sup> per qd for 2 consecutive days through a mini @-@ pump ( MP ) with a 24 h gap followed by selumetinib 25 mg kg @<sup> –1 </sup> per bid for 14 consecutive days ( schedule 1 ) or the reverse of this schedule where barasertib was dosed following selumetinib treatment ( schedule 2 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5A </xref> ) .
The CaLu-6 NSCLC human tumour xenograft model was used in this study as previous experience with both agents allowed us to select appropriate dose levels in order to investigate these schedules ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"> Davies <i> et al </i> , 2007 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"> Wilkinson <i> et al </i> , 2007 </xref> ) .
Selumetinib and barasertib alone resulted in 57 % ( <i> P </i> < 0.005 ) and 95 % ( <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) tumour growth inhibition compared with the vehicle @-@ treated controls at day 21 after the start of dosing .
In comparison when selumetinib was dosed before barasertib the anti @-@ tumour efficacy was 74 % ( <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) in contrast to 106 % ( <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) observed when selumetinib was dosed following barasertib .
At 21 days after the start of dosing the control , animals had to be culled due to tumour size ; however , the monotherapy and combination @-@ treated groups were kept on study for a further 14 days .
During this time , the tumours in the monotherapy and schedule 2 groups started to re @-@ grow .
Interestingly , the tumours in the group where barasertib was administered before selumetinib ( schedule 1 ) tumour re @-@ growth was delayed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5B </xref> ) .
In order to investigate this further , we performed pharmacodynamic analysis on tumour tissue .
In schedule 1 we analysed tumour tissue at 24 h after the end of the barasertib infusion ( PD1 ) and at the end of the selumetinib @-@ dosing period ( PD2 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5A </xref> ) .
In schedule 2 , tumours were harvested 24 h after the end of the barasertib infusion at the end of the study ( PD3 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5A </xref> ) .
Using flow cytometry we assessed tissues for polyploidy and demonstrated that compared with the vehicle @-@ treated control group , barasertib @-@ treated tumours resulted in increased polyploidy ( 1.7 @-@ fold change ; <i> P </i> < 0.05 ) in the PD1 samples consistent with the mechanism of this agent ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5C </xref> ) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"> Wilkinson <i> et al </i> , 2007 </xref> ) .
In the same experiment , we monitored the population of sub G1 cells in these groups .
At the end of the dosing period in schedule 1 ( PD2 ) , there was a significant increase ( 3.5 @-@ fold change ; <i> P </i> < 0.0005 ) in the sub G1 population in the combination compared with the vehicle @-@ treated controls and selumetinib monotherapy ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5Cii </xref> ) .
In comparison , the sub G1 populations in schedule 2 ( PD3 ) were increased ∼2 @-@ fold in both the monotherapy and combination groups ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5Dii </xref> ) .
These results suggest that the sustained anti @-@ tumour effect and regression observed when barasertib is scheduled before selumetinib is likely to be due to an avoidance of cell cycle @-@ mediated antagonism which allowed an increase in cell death .
Fourteen cutaneous melanoma cell lines with different driver mutations were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of TAK733 , with a higher proportion of <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant cell lines being highly sensitive with IC50 s below 1 nM .
The five uveal melanoma cell lines had GNAQ or GNA11 mutations and were either moderately or highly sensitive to TAK733 .
The tested cell lines wild type for <i> NRAS , BRAF , GNAQ </i> and <i> GNA11 </i> driver mutations were moderately to highly resistant to TAK733 .
TAK733 led to a decrease in pERK and G1 arrest in most of these melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin , driver oncogenic mutations and <i> in vitro </i> sensitivity to TAK733 .
MEK inhibition resulted in increase in pMEK more prominently in <i> NRAS </i> <sup> <i> Q61L </i> </sup> mutant and <i> GNAQ </i> mutant cell lines than in <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant cell lines .
Uptake of the metabolic tracers FDG and FLT was inhibited by TAK733 in a manner that closely paralleled the <i> in vitro </i> sensitivity assays .
Sensitivity of cutaneous and uveal melanoma cell lines to TAK733
Cutaneous and uveal melanoma cell lines were cultured <i> in vitro </i> in the presence of increasing concentrations of TAK-733 for 72 hours to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) in cell proliferation assays .
Cell lines with an IC50 less than 10 nM were considered sensitive , and cell lines with IC50 less than 1 nM were considered highly sensitive .
Among 12 <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutated cutaneous cell lines tested , seven were highly sensitive to TAK-733 with IC50 s less than 1 nM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1 ) .
Five <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant cutaneous cell lines had an IC50 higher than 100 nM and were considered highly resistant to this agent ..
Among ten <i> NRAS </i> <sup> <i> Q61 </i> </sup> mutant cutaneous melanoma cell lines , four were sensitive with IC50 s below 10 nM , but none was highly sensitive .
Our panel also included five cutaneous melanoma cell lines wild type for mutations in <i> NRAS , BRAF , GNAQ </i> and <i> GNA11 </i> and only one was highly sensitive to TAK733 with IC50 s below 1 nM , while two were considered sensitive with IC50 less than 10 nM .
All five uveal melanoma cell lines were sensitive to TAK733 with IC50 values below 10 nM , with three of them being highly sensitive .
All these cell lines carried <i> GNAQ </i> or <i> GNA11 </i> driver mutations ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Overall , there was a clear trend of higher sensitivity in <i> BRAF </i> mutant cell lines , but all subgroups included cell lines with variable sensitivity and also high resistance to exposure to the MEK inhibitor .

TAK733 has similar inhibitory effects on cell cycle in sensitive and resistant cutaneous melanoma cell lines
To study the effects of TAK733 on cell cycle progression downstream of MEK signaling we used DAPI flow cytometric staining ( representative examples of flow histograms in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ a and b ) .
For these studies we chose two <i> NRAS </i> mutants and four <i> BRAF </i> mutants that represented the spectrum of sensitivities of these cell lines .
The <i> NRAS </i> mutants M207 ( sensitive ) and M244 ( highly resistant ) both had a dose @-@ dependent G1 arrest with increasing concentrations of TAK733 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ c ) .
The same was evident with the four <i> BRAF </i> mutants , including the two with high sensitivity ( M229 and M249 ) and the highly resistant ( M233 and M263 ) .
The sub @-@ G1 peak also did not predict the cell proliferation assay results , even though the sharpest increase was in M249 , one of the most sensitive cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> a and c ) .
Overall , TAK733 exposure for up to 48 hours led to a similar G1 arrest in melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin , driver oncogenic mutations and <i> in vitro </i> sensitivity to TAK733 ) .
Modulation of MAPK and PI3k @/@ akt signaling pathways upon exposure to TAK733
To explore how cell lines with different mutations respond differently to TAK733 we analyzed signaling pathways in representative cell lines with similar growth kinetics but with markedly different sensitivities to TAK733 .
Among the <i> NRAS </i> <sup> <i> Q61L </i> </sup> mutant cutaneous group we chose the resistant M244 and the sensitive M207 .
Among the <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant cutaneous group we chose M229 and M249 as representatives of highly sensitive cutaneous cell lines , and M233 and M263 as resistant cutaneous cell lines .
In our panel , all the uveal melanoma cell lines were sensitive to TAK733 and we picked three as representative samples with <i> GNAQ </i> mutations .
As expected based on prior data [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] , MEK inhibition resulted in increase of pMEK in non @- @<i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) .
This was more prominent in <i> NRAS </i> <sup> <i> Q61L </i> </sup> mutant and uveal melanoma cell lines than in <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant cell lines , which had a higher baseline level of pMEK .
In all cases , TAK733 induced a marked dose @-@ dependent decrease of pERK , regardless of the driver oncogenic mutation or the sensitivity or resistance to this agent in cell viability assays .
On the contrary , effects on pAKT and pS6K varied according to the cell origin , oncogenic events and sensitivity to TAK733 .
<i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant cell lines resistant to TAK733 showed no inhibition of pAKT or pS6K , while there was a general trend towards inhibition of these two phosphorylated molecules in sensitive cell lines .
Of note , in the uveal melanoma cell lines and in the cutaneous melanoma cell line M229 , the baseline level of pAKT was undetectable by Western blot , so no inhibition could be recorded in them .
Changes in pS6 tended to follow changes in pS6K in the cutaneous melanoma cell lines but not in the uveal melanoma cell lines .
In a time @-@ course analysis of signaling events upon exposure to TAK733 , both the sensitive M229 and the resistant M233 cell lines with <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutations showed initial inhibition of pERK , but the resistant cell line recovered pERK signaling with time ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) .
This different time @-@ course effect was not evident for the inhibition of pAKT or pS6K in the resistant cell line , while they were permanently inhibited over the 48 hour study period in the sensitive cell line .
Differential metabolic tracer uptake between cell lines sensitive and resistant to TAK733
We explored the use of metabolic tracers to differentiate response or resistance to TAK733 in six cutaneous melanoma cell lines with the goal of a future use of these tracers in PET scanning studies in the clinic .
Thymidine is taken up by proliferating cells and the PET tracer [ @<sup> 18 </sup> F ] FLT can be used in patients .
Consistent with the cell cycle analysis data , all the tested cell lines had some degree of inhibition of tritium @-@ labeled thymidine ( <sup> 3 </sup>@ H-thymidine ) uptake upon exposure to TAK733 regardless of their sensitivity <i> in vitro </i>@ .
The highest levels of inhibition were in the highly sensitive <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant cell lines M229 and M249 and the relatively resistant M263 cell line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ a ) .
Changes in uptake of tritium @-@ labeled 2 ' @-@ deoxy @- @<sc> D </sc>@ -@ glucose ( <sup> 3 </sup>@ H-2DDG ) were analyzed to study effects of TAK733 on PET scans with the commonly used PET tracer [ @<sup> 18 </sup>@ F ] FDG .
The lowest degree of inhibition was in the two most resistant cell lines , the <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant M233 and the <i> NRAS </i> <sup> <i> Q61K </i> </sup> mutant M244 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ b ) .
Therefore , changes in the uptake of the <sup> 3 </sup>@ H-2DDG metabolic tracer most closely followed the results of the cell viability assays .
<i> In-vitro </i> inhibition of cell proliferation by selumetinib treatment in NSCLC and CRC cell lines
We first evaluated the sensitivity to the selective MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor , selumetinib , in a panel of five NSCLC ( GLC82 , H460 , A549 , H1299 , Calu3 ) and six CRC ( GEO , HCT15 , HCT116 , SW480 , SW620 , LS174T ) cell lines by using the MTT assay .
Cancer cells were treated with selumetinib at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ for 48 , 72 , and 96 h .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1 </xref> , there was a wide range of sensitivity , with IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values varying between 0.01 and > 10 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ.
We classified as sensitive ( S ) or resistant ( R ) the cancer cell lines according to selumetinib IC @<sub> 50 </sub> at 96 h ⩽ 1 or > 1 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ, respectively .
This concentration was chosen based on the data from phase I studies , which indicated that 1 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ was within the average plasma concentrations of selumetinib achieved in patients at the maximum tolerated dose for this agent ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"> Adjei <i> et al </i> , 2008 </xref> ) .
Overall , 67 % ( four of six ) CRC and 40 % ( two of five ) NSCLC cell lines had a selumetinib IC @<sub> 50 </sub> of ⩽ 1 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ.
In particular , among the sensitive cancer cell lines there were four , two NSCLC ( Calu3 and H1299 ) and two CRC ( HCT116 and SW620 ) , extremely sensitive to selumetinib with an IC @<sub> 50 </sub> of ⩽ 0.01 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1A and B </xref> ) .
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the different sensitivities to the drug , we conducted experiments on a group of four cancer cell lines representing both selumetinib @-@ sensitive ( HCT116 and Calu3 ) and selumetinib @-@ resistant ( HCT15 and H460 ) models .
Effects of selumetinib treatment on cell @-@ cycle distribution in NSCLC and CRC cell lines
We conducted flow cytometric analysis to compare the cell @-@ cycle distribution following treatment of the selumetinib @-@ sensitive HCT116 and Calu3 cancer cell lines and of the selumetinib @-@ resistant HCT15 and H460 cancer cell lines .
Cancer cells were treated with selumetinib at the IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values for inhibition of cell proliferation for 24 , 48 , and 72 h .
Twenty @-@ four hours selumetinib treatment caused cell accumulation in the G1 phase and concomitant reduction in the S phase as compared with controls in selumetinib @-@ sensitive cancer cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2A </xref> ) .
The arrest in the G1 phase was significantly increased with longer ( 48 and 72 h ) treatment with selumetinib in both HCT116 and Calu3 cells .
This effect was also paralleled by a time @-@ dependent reduction in the S phase in both selumetinib @-@ sensitive cancer cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2A </xref> ) .
In contrast , no effect was observed on cell @-@ cycle distribution in the two selumetinib @-@ resistant HCT15 and H460 cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2A </xref> ) .
These results were supported also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"> Garon <i> et al </i> ( 2010 ) </xref> , in which the block in G1 phase inducted by selumetinib is evident only in sensitive cell lines .
Effects of selumetinib treatment on the induction of apoptosis in NSCLC and CRC cell lines
Several preclinical models have demonstrated that selumetinib act as a cytotoxic drug rather than cytostatic by inducing proapoptotic activity ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"> Huynh <i> et al </i> , 2007a </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> Huynh <i> et al </i> , 2007b </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"> Meng <i> et al </i> , 2009 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"> Meng <i> et al </i> , 2010 </xref> ) .
To confirm this effect , the induction of apoptosis was evaluated using an FACS @-@ based assay for Annexin V and PI staining .
After 24 h of selumetinib treatment , a significant induction of apoptosis was detected in the sensitive HCT116 and Calu3 cancer cell lines , which was maximal following 72 h of treatment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2B </xref> ) .
Moreover , apoptosis was not detectable following treatment with selumetinib in the two resistant HCT15 and H460 cancer cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2B </xref> ) .
Effects of selumetinib treatment on intracellular signalling in NSCLC and CRC cell lines
To assess the effects of selumetinib treatment on key intracellular downstream signalling pathways , western blots were performed to assess total and phosphorylated EGFR and downstream effectors ( total MEK1 @/@ MEK2 , phospho @-@ MEK1 @/@ MEK2 , total MAPK , phospho @-@ MAPK , total AKT , phospho @-@ AKT , total 4EBP1 , and phosho @-@ 4EBP1 ) .
Cancer cells were evaluated at baseline and at different time points after treatment with selumetinib at 0.05 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ.
No change in total and phosphorylated EGFR expression was observed in both selumetinib @-@ sensitive and selumetinib @-@ resistant cancer cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A–D </xref> ) .
Treatment with selumetinib caused a time @-@ dependent inhibition in phospho @-@ MEK1 @/@ MEK2 with a complete signal suppression within 60 or 15 min of treatment in HCT116 and Calu3 cells , respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A and B </xref> ) .
This inhibition was sustained for 24 h of selumetinib treatment in both cancer cell lines .
In contrast , MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibition of protein phosphorylation was less effective with only a slight reduction in pospho @-@ MEK1 @/@ MEK2 in the two selumetinib @-@ resistant HCT15 and H460 cancer cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3C and D </xref> ) .
Moreover , MAPK phosphorylation was completely blocked following selumetinib treatment in HCT116 and Calu3 .
In contrast , in the two selumetinib @-@ resistant HCT15 and H460 cells MAPK phosphorylation was only reduced but never completely abrogated ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3C and D </xref> ) .
We next assessed the levels of AKT , phosphor @-@ AKT , 4EBP1 and poshospho @-@ 4EBP1 , which are downstream effectors of the PI3 kinase ( PI3K ) pathway .
Previous reports have suggested that resistance to selumetinib treatment in CRC and NSCLC cell lines was associated with baseline increased PI3K signalling ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"> Balmanno <i> et al </i> , 2009 </xref> ) .
However , as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3E–H </xref> , we failed to segregate the panel of 11 NSCLC and CRC cell lines into selumetinib @-@ sensitive and selumetinib @-@ resistant groups , by using the PI3K pathway .
Effects of selumetinib treatment on NSCLC and CRC tumour xenografts in nude mice
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4A and B </xref> , HCT116 and Calu3 xenograft growth was significantly inhibited by selumetinib treatment in a dose @-@ dependent manner .
As an example , at day 50 from the injection of cancer cells , the mean tumour volume in mice bearing HCT116 tumour xenografts and treated with selumetinib , 25 or 50 mg kg @<sup> −1 </sup> were 40 % and 15 % , respectively , as compared with control untreated mice .
Similarly , at day 50 from the injection of cancer cells , the mean tumour volume in mice bearing Calu3 tumour xenografts and treated with selumetinib , 25 or 50 mg kg @<sup> −1 </sup> were 22 % and 8 % , respectively , as compared with control untreated mice .
In contrast , selumetinib treatment was unable to affect tumour growth in both HCT15 and H460 tumour xenografts ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4C and D </xref> ) .
EGFR , RAS , MEK , and AKT protein expression and selumetinib sensitivity in NSCLC and CRC cell lines
Identification of predictive biomarkers is becoming a fundamental aspect in the development of targeted agents .
So far , several preclinical studies have been published trying to address this aspect for the sensitivity to MEK inhibitors , but , since different results have been reported , no univocal interpretation could be made ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"> Balmanno <i> et al </i> , 2009 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"> Dry <i> et al </i> , 2010 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"> Garon <i> et al </i> , 2010 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44"> Tendler <i> et al </i> , 2010 ) </xref>@ .
To identify specific profiles , which could allow identifying different molecular patterns of sensitivity or resistance to MEK inhibition , we first screened the intracellular signalling status of each cell lines .
As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure 1A </xref> , the NCSLC and CRC cell lines displayed highly variable basal levels of total and phosphorylated EGFR , RAS , MEK , and AKT .
As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure 1B </xref> , there was no apparent correlation between basal levels of total and phosphorylated proteins listed above in both tumour types .
Gene mutations and selumetinib sensitivity in NSCLC and CRC cell lines
Activation of the classic MAPK cascade ( RAS @-@ RAF @-@ MEK @-@ ERK ) is a common event in colorectal and lung cancer .
Some genes within this pathway are mutated or aberrantly expressed .
Moreover , the MAPK pathway can be indirectly activated by mutations of genes encoding for PI3K @/@ PTEN @/@ AKT and p53 .
We have screened the panel of 11 NSCLC and CRC cell lines for mutations in <i> KRAS , NRAS , BRAF , PIK3CA , p53 , PTEN , MEK1 @/@ MEK2 , AKT , EGFR </i> ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Table 1A–F </xref> ) .
In NSCLC cell lines , two out of five ( 40 % ) harboured a <i> KRAS </i> mutation , which was located in codon 12 or 13 .
Moreover , three out of five ( 60 % ) of NSCLC cells harboured a <i> PI3KCA </i> mutation , which were located in exon 9 or 20 .
A concomitant mutation in <i> KRAS </i> and <i> PI3KCA </i> gene was found in two out of five ( 40 % ) NSCLC .
One NSCLC cell line had an <i> NRAS </i> mutation ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Table 1A–F </xref> ) .
In the panel of six CRC cell lines , all of them harboured a <i> KRAS </i> gene mutation that was located in codon 12 or 13 .
Moreover , half of CRC cell lines had both a <i> PI3KCA </i> mutation in exon 9 or 20 and a <i> KRAS </i> mutation .
None of the CRC cells had an <i> NRAS </i> mutation .
No <i> BRAF </i> mutations were observed in the whole panel of NSCLC and CRC cells .
As reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Table 1E and F </xref> , no other gene mutations were found in both NSCLC and CRC cell lines .
After this screening , we tried to correlate the mutational status with selumetinib sensitivity .
The analysis was made either considering separately the two sets of cell lines ( data not shown ) or all together ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure 2A and B </xref> ) .
Sensitivity to selumetinib did not seem to correlate with any specific gene mutations in this panel of NSCLC and CRC cell lines .
Identification of gene expression profiles that could be predictive of response to selumetinib in NSCLC and CRC cell lines
RNAs from the 11 cancer cell lines were extracted and used for microarray gene expression analysis .
Using Student 's <i> t </i>@ -@ test with Benjamini @–@ Hochberg multiple test correction , 21 and 18 genes were identified as upregulated or downregulated , respectively , in selumetinib @-@ resistant cancer cell lines ( <i> t </i>@ -@ test , <i> P </i> < 0.05 ) ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure 3 </xref> ) .
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2 </xref> lists the differentially expressed genes in selumetinib @-@ resistant cancer cell lines .
Among the 21 genes that were upregulated in selumetinib @-@ resistant cancer cell lines , we identified two genes , <i> ADCY7 </i> and <i> AKAP13 , </i> which are involved in the cAMP @-@ dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) pathway ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2A </xref> ; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure 3 </xref> ) .
The <i> ADCY7 </i> gene encodes a membrane @-@ bound adenylatecyclase that convert ATP into 3 ' , 5 ' @-@ adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) and pyrophosphate ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure 4 </xref> ) .
The cAMP is a second messenger that has a key role in intracellular signalling transduction .
A major function in mammalian cells is the activation of the PKA ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"> Tasken <i> et al </i> , 1997 </xref> ) .
The <i> AKAP13 </i> gene encodes the A-kinase anchor protein 13 that has the function of binding to the regulatory subunits of PKA ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure 4 </xref> ) .
Moreover , four genes ( <i> NCOA3 , TAF3 , NR1H2 </i> , and <i> RXRA </i> ) , which are upregulated in selumetinib @-@ resistant cancer cell lines , belong to the retinoic acid pathway , which is also activated by PKA ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"> Altucci <i> et al </i> , 2007 </xref> ) .
Treatment with selective PKA inhibitors sensitises selumetinib @-@ resistant cancer cell lines to selumetinib
To functionally evaluate if the cAMP @-@ dependent PKA could mediate resistance to MEK inhibitor treatment , we have treated the panel of NSCLC and CRC with 8-Cl-cAMP , a site @-@ selective cAMP analogue , which specifically inhibits PKAI , the PKA isoform that is directly involved in mitogenic signalling and the transformed phenotype ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"> Tortora and Ciardiello , 2000 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33"> Naviglio <i> et al </i> , 2009 </xref> ) .
A dose @-@ dependent inhibition of growth was observed in all cancer cell lines with a different degree of sensitivity , as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5A </xref>@ .
To evaluate the interaction between selumetinib and 8-Cl-cAMP , combination analyses were done .
The CRC and NSCLC cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of selumetinib ( range , 0.01 @–@ 10 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ ) and 8-Cl-cAMP ( range , 0.01 @–@ 5 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ ) each day , for a total of 3 days at a fixed drug ratio selumetinib to 8-Cl-cAMP of 1 : 1 .
In all selumetinib @-@ resistant cancer cell lines , the combination treatment caused synergistic growth inhibitory effects .
In fact , the CI values for the combinations treatments ranged between 0.013 and 0.350 .
This was significantly different in the selumetinib @-@ sensitive cancer cells in which the combination treatment was clearly antagonistic with CI between 1.3 and 3.6 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5B </xref> ) .
We next assessed the phosphorylation state of MEK and MAPK following treatment with selumetinib , 8-Cl-cAMP as single agents or in combination with HCT15 and H460 cancer cell lines .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3C </xref> , single agent selumetinib or 8-Cl-cAMP slightly inhibited p-MEK and p-MAPK , whereas the combination induced a significant inhibition of both phosphorylated proteins .
A genetic approach to inhibiting PKAI expression was developed by the use of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides targeting the synthesis of the PKAI regulatory subunit RI @<i> α </i>@ .
These oligonucleotides inhibit growth of several human cancer cell lines <i> in vitro </i> and <i> in vivo </i> ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49"> Yokozaki <i> et al </i> , 1993 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"> Nesterova and Cho @-@ Chung , 1995 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45"> Tortora <i> et al </i> , 1997a </xref> ) .
Therefore , HYB 190 , an 18 @-@ mer MBO antisense to the N-terminal 8 @–@ 13 codons of the RI @<i> α </i> subunit of PKAI , and the control HYB 239 , containing four mismatched bases , were tested to study the effect on the growth of NSCLC and CRC cell lines .
All cancer cell lines treated with HBY 190 displayed a dose @-@ dependent inhibition of growth by MTT assay ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6A </xref> ) .
Growth inhibition was more pronounced in selumetinib @-@ resistant cancer cell lines ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> between 0.25 and 1 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ ) , while the IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values were > 5 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ in the selumetinib @-@ sensitive cancer cells .
In contrast , the control oligonucleotide , HYB 239 , at doses up to 5 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ, showed only 5 @–@ 15 % growth inhibition among all of the cell lines tested ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6A </xref> ) .
To determine whether a combination of selumetinib and oligonucleotide HYB 190 could enhance the antiproliferative effect compared with either agent alone , selumetinib @-@ resistant cells were treated with different combinations of the two agents at a fixed drug ratio of 1 : 1 .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6B </xref> , the combination treatment caused synergistic growth inhibitory effects .
To determine whether the growth inhibitory effect of oligonucleotide HYB 190 correlated with a reduction in RI @<i> α </i> protein levels , we performed protein blots on total cell extracts prepared from H460 cells treated with oligonucleotide HYB 190 , oligonucleotide HYB 239 , selumetinib , and combinations .
Compared with untreated H460 cells , RI @<i> α </i> levels were substantially unchanged , even in cells treated with a higher dose of the control oligonucleotide HYB 239 ( 1 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ ) and selumetinib ( 5 <i> μ </i>@ ℳ ) .
However , reduction of RI @<i> α </i> expression was seen when H460 cells were treated with oligonucleotide HYB 190 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6C </xref> ) .
Moreover , a complete inhibition of RI @<i> α </i> expression was seen in the combination treatment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6C </xref> ) .
We finally evaluated whether the combined inhibition of both PKA and MEK pathways would have antitumour activity <i> in vivo </i> in selumetinib @-@ resistant HCT15 and H460 xenografts ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref> ) .
At day 50 from cancer cell injection , the mean tumour volume in mice bearing HCT15 and H460 tumour xenografts and treated with selumetinib , 25 mg kg @<sup> −1 </sup> , and 8-Cl-cAMP , 0.5 mg kg @<sup> −1 </sup> , were 20 % and 16 % , respectively , as compared with control untreated mice .
In a cohort of 144 metastatic melanoma patients we found that patients with N-RAS mutant melanoma had a worse prognosis .
These patients were more likely to have brain metastases at the time of presentation with metastatic disease than their N-RAS @-@ wild-type counterparts .
All N-RAS mutant melanoma cultures tested in our study ( n = 7 ) were sensitive to MEK inhibition162 .
Exposure to MEK162 reduced ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation , and induced apoptosis .
Clonogenic survival was significantly reduced in sensitive melanoma cell cultures .
Clinical profiles of patients whose tumors harbor N-RAS and B-RAF mutations
Characteristics of our cohort of 144 patients with stage IV melanoma are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref>@ .
Mutations were found in B-RAF in 43.7 % , N-RAS in 27.7 % , and 28.4 % were wild type ( WT ) for both .
The majority of B-RAF mutations were represented by substitution of valine at position 600 to glutamic acid ( 74.6 % were B-RAF @<sup> V600E </sup> ) or to lysine ( 19 % were B-RAF @<sup> V600K </sup> ) .
Substitutions of glutamine 61 accounted for 95 % of N-RAS mutations ( most frequently Q61R @/@ K @/@ L @/@ H ) .
The slightly higher percentage of N-RAS mutant melanomas in our population than what is commonly reported may be a result of the relatively small sample size or a reflection of local demographics .
Clinical and pathological characteristics
Patients with B-RAF mutations tended to be younger ; median age at initial diagnosis of melanoma was 57.6 in patients with B-RAF mutations , 68.2 in patients with N-RAS mutations and 66.3 years in patients wild-type for both ( P < 0.0001 ) .
Our cohort included 22 patients who received either dabrafenib ( N = 1 ) , vemurafenib ( N = 19 ) , a pan @-@ RAF inhibitor ( N = 1 ) or a pan @-@ RAF inhibitor and vemurafenib ( N = 1 ) .
Patients with N-RAS mutated melanomas appear to have an increased rate of skin and soft tissue involvement ( 70 % ) compared to B-RAF mutated counterparts and WT patients ( 37 % and 41 % respectively , P = 0.0025 ) .
The rate of lymph node metastasis was also noted to be higher in patients with N-RAS mutations ( 75 % ) compared to B-RAF mutant and WT patients ( 46 % and 61 % , respectively ) ( P = 0.01 ) .
No statistically significant difference was seen between the genotypes and other clinical characteristics , such as M stage and LDH levels.Seeing that B-RAF inhibitors can affect survival in patients with B-RAF mutant melanomas , this group of patients was removed from the survival analysis .
By Cox univariate analysis we found a trend towards shorter survival in the N-RAS mutant population , compared to the B-RAF and WT groups combined ( p = 0.12 ) .
The median survival was 13 and 19.6 months , respectively .
Kaplan @-@ Meier survival curves are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ a for the three groups of patients ( BRAF or NRAS mutant or WT for both ) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ b for the two groups ( NRAS compared to BRAF mutant and WT combined ) to visually demonstrate the differences between the groups .
Interestingly , analysis of anatomic sites at the time of initial diagnosis of stage IV disease revealed a higher rate of brain involvement among B-RAF ( 16 % ) and N-RAS ( 15 % ) mutant melanoma patients , compared with patients with WT disease ( 2.5 % ) ( P = 0.04 ) .
With longitudinal follow @-@ up , however , the rate of development of brain metastases did not differ among the three groups , possibly because the WT groups lived longer and thus developed brain metastases over time .
<i> In vitro </i> activity of B-RAF and MEK inhibitors in a large panel of melanoma cultures
To investigate the effect of B-RAF and MEK inhibition in melanoma cultures , we used RAF265 ( a pan @-@ RAF inhibitor ) , MEK162 ( a MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor ) and the MEK inhibitor trametinib .
A panel of 22 patient @-@ derived melanoma cultures was used ; the IC @<sub> 50 </sub> for RAF265 and MEK162 are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref>@ .
This was compared to the IC @<sub> 50 </sub> for trametinib ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Table S1 ) .
Patient @-@ derived melanoma cultures with their B-RAF @/@ N-RAS mutational status and sensitivity to RAF265 and MEK162
Cells were treated with each drug individually at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 1000 nM and analyzed three days later .
As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> , the IC @<sub> 50 </sub> for RAF265 ranged from 24 to > 10000 nM , 4 to 2004 nM , and 62 to 2082 nM for WT , B-RAF mutant and N-RAS mutant cultures , respectively .
The IC @<sub> 50 </sub> for MEK162 ranged from 10 to > 10000 nM , < 1 to 150 nM , and 4 to 13 nM for WT , B-RAF mutant and N-RAS mutant melanoma cultures , respectively .
The sensitivity to RAF265 in wild type ( 2 out of 5 ) and N-RAS ( 2 out of 7 ) melanoma cultures was low .
Two wild type cultures ( YUROB and YUSOC ) are sensitive to both RAF265 and MEK162 .
Six of ten B-RAF mutant cultures were sensitive to RAF265 , and seven out of ten were sensitive to MEK162 .
In N-RAS mutant melanoma cultures , 2 out of 7 were sensitive to RAF265 and , strikingly , all were sensitive to MEK162 .
Of the 7 N-RAS mutant cultures , 5 were sensitive to trametinib .
YUFIC and YUTICA were more resistant .
Molecular effects of MEK162
Due to the striking sensitivity patterns of MEK162 , we conducted additional studies to verify target down-regulation in the sensitive and resistant cultures .
ERK1 @/@ ERK2 isoforms are the immediate downstream substrates and best studied effectors of dual specificity kinases MEK1 @/@ MEK2 .
To assess the effect of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibition on ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation state ( phosphorylation at T202 @/@ Y204 sites ) , melanoma cultures were treated with MEK162 and compared with untreated controls .
We selected one sensitive and one resistant culture in the WT and B-RAF mutant categories .
Seeing that all N-RAS mutant cultures were sensitive to MEK162 , we selected two sensitive cultures for these studies .
WT ( YUVON and YUROB ) , B-RAF mutant ( YUKSI and YUMAC ) and N-RAS mutant ( YUDOSO and YUKIM ) cells were treated with increasing doses ( 10 @-@ 1000 nM ) of MEK162 or left untreated for 4 and 24 hours .
Western blot analysis was performed using phospho @-@ ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , total ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and β-actin antibodies , and results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A.In the MEK162 resistant melanoma cultures ( YUVON and YUKSI ) , the baseline level of phospho @-@ ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and the ratio of phospho @-@ ERK1 @/@ ERK2 to total ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was lower compared to sensitive cultures ( YUROB , YUMAC , YUDOSO , YUKIM ) .
In MEK162 @-@ sensitive melanomas exposure to MEK162 resulted in a significant decrease in the level of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Genetic targeting of mutant <i> BRAF </i> resulted in restoration of sensitivity to serum starvation @-@ induced apoptosis and efficiently inhibited cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors .
Among tested agents , the B-Raf inhibitor dabrafenib was found to induce a strong V600E @-@ dependent shift in cell viability .
In contrast , no differential sensitizing effect was observed for conventional chemotherapeutic agents ( mitomycin C , oxaliplatin , paclitaxel , etoposide , 5 @-@ fluorouracil ) , nor for the targeted agents cetuximab , sorafenib , vemurafenib , RAF265 , or for inhibition of PI3 kinase .
Treatment with dabrafenib efficiently inhibited phosphorylation of the B-Raf downstream targets Mek 1 @/@ 2 and Erk 1 @/@ 2 .
<i> BRAF </i> targeting in RKO
It has been shown that B-Raf @<sup> V600E </sup> is sufficient to promote proliferation via Erk 1 @/@ 2 signaling independently of exogenous growth factors and confers mechanisms to evade apoptosis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref>@ ] .
However , these results are primarily based on non @-@ quantitative RNA interference ( RNAi ) methods which are prone to artifacts in mammalian cells due to nonspecific defense mechanisms [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"> 17 </xref>@ ] .
In contrast , somatic cell gene targeting enables quantitative knockouts of single alleles ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) and the generation of endogenous models featuring well @-@ defined genetic backgrounds [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"> 18 </xref>@ ] .
Utilizing this method , we have disrupted <i> BRAF </i> alleles in the colorectal cancer cell line RKO and established syngeneic clones which harbor a single <i> BRAF </i> allele of either wild-type or mutant genotype .
Despite its near @-@ diploid karyotype and MSI phenotype , the colorectal cancer cell line RKO carries a stable triplication of the <i> BRAF </i> gene locus ( dup ( 7 ) ( q21q36 ) ) with one wild-type and two mutant alleles present in parental cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"> 13 </xref>@ ] .
This genotype was verified by DNA sequencing in RKO @-@ E1 , a subclone obtained from RKO that was found to be comparable to the parental cell line in terms of morphology and proliferation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B and data not shown ) .
In the first targeting round , an oncogenic allele of <i> BRAF </i> exon 15 was recombined and deleted by somatic cell gene targeting to generate the cell clone RBOW ( RKO @-@ derived <i> BRAF </i> <sup> onc @/@ wt/- </sup> ) .
Subsequently , either wild-type or V600E @-@ mutant B-Raf was disrupted by targeting a second allele in RBOW , yielding six <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ mutant and one wild-type clone from approximately 10 @<sup> 4 </sup> screened colonies .
Out of these double positive clones , <i> BRAF </i> knockout cell lines RBO-1 and RBO-2 ( RKO @-@ derived <i> BRAF </i> <sup> onc/ -/- </sup> 1 and 2 ) as well as RBW-1 ( RKO @-@ derived <i> BRAF </i> <sup> wt/ -/- </sup> ) were established ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
The apparent counterselection against inactivation of B Raf @<sup> V600E </sup> might indicate the presence of an oncogene addiction for B-Raf @<sup> V600E </sup> as a cancer cell trait in RKO [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"> 19 </xref>@ ] .
For structural confirmation of the deleted alleles , DNA sequencing was performed and all genotypes were verified ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
Furthermore , all cells expressed <i> BRAF </i> protein at comparable levels ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ C ) .
While the expression of Mek 1 @/@ 2 and Erk 1 @/@ 2 was independent of serum concentration and <i> BRAF </i> status , the phosphorylation of these effector kinases was constantly active in the <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ mutant clones but low in <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ wild-type cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ C ) .
This was found to be independent of the serum concentration , indicating that the phosphorylation status of Mek and Erk is dependent on mutant <i> BRAF </i> in RKO .
Cell @-@ biological phenotypes related to mutant <i> BRAF </i>
Under standard long-term cell culture conditions no differences in morphology or growth were observed between the cell clones ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Expectedly , decreased serum concentrations led to lower proliferation rates in these cells , but exponential growth was sustained under all applied conditions .
However , the withdrawal of serum resulted in the inhibition of cell growth of the wild-type cells RBW-1 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ B and C ) .
It has been shown previously that <i> BRAF </i> wild-type cells require glucose supply for survival whereas <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ mutant cell clones maintain proliferation in low @-@ glucose environments [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
Here we show that the V600E mutation of B-Raf also provides independency of serum @-@ derived growth signals in RKO and that targeting of oncogenically mutant <i> BRAF </i> is sufficient to deprive this vital feature of malignancy from the cells , thereby corroborating previous reports [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"> 6 </xref>@ ] .
Sustained proliferative signaling is considered one of the major traits of cancer cells and is therefore used as a target mechanism of individualized therapy approaches including anti EGFR therapy strategies in colorectal cancer [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref>@ ] .
In another context , mutant B-Raf induced cellular senescence rather than proliferation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
However , senescence can be overcome by phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) / AKT signaling [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] which is hyperactivated in RKO due to a <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation .
By staining of senescence @-@ associated β-galactosidase activity [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] we examined whether the differential proliferation rates observed upon serum deprivation were attributable to cellular senescence .
Cellular senescence was detected at very low levels in less than 5 % of cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ D-E ) , indicating that senescence alone can not explain the strong reduction in cell growth observed upon withdrawal of serum .
Flow cytometry revealed a significant increase of apoptotic cells in wild-type compared to mutant clones upon withdrawal of serum ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ F and G ) .
Apoptosis was confirmed by the detection of cleaved caspase 3 at considerable levels in serum @-@ starved RBW-1 , while all other samples showed full @-@ length protein only ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ H ) .
Consistent with RKO modeling a distinct subpopulation of patients characterized by the presence of certain molecular features and the absence of others [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"> 7 </xref>@ ] , no implication of p53 in apoptosis was observed ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ H ) .
Since serum starvation is often used to model apoptosis mediated via the PUMA pathway [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref>@ ] , we also analyzed PUMA protein levels .
PUMA was found to be highly abundant specifically in serum starved RBW-1 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ H ) .
Consistent with data previously shown by others , starvation @-@ induced apoptosis is mediated by PUMA in a p53 @-@ independent fashion in our experiments [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] .
Programmed cell death is a key feature of proliferation control in homeostasis and overcoming apoptosis is considered another hallmark of cancer cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref>@ ] .
Since virtually all malignant cancer cells show apoptosis resistance , the induction of apoptotic pathways is considered a particularly promising approach for therapeutic strategies [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"> 29 </xref>@ ] .
Our results show that in RKO this particular cancer cell trait is modulated by and dependent on B-Raf @<sup> V600E </sup> and that targeting mutant <i> BRAF </i> is sufficient to restore sensitivity to caspase @-@ dependent apoptosis after serum withdrawal via p53 @-@ independent PUMA induction [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] .
Complementing and extending previous studies , we thus provide evidence from an endogenous and quantitative genetic model of <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ mutant colorectal cancer cells , thereby ruling out the occurrence of artifacts caused by unspecific cellular response or incomplete knockdown in RNAi setups and , likewise , avoiding inter @-@ species bias potentially experienced in mouse models of colorectal cancer [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref>@ ] .
Sensitivity fell into three groups : sensitive , 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> ) < 1 μM ; intermediately sensitive , IC @<sub> 50 </sub> 1 @-@ 2 μM ; and resistant , > 2 μM . Fifteen of 21 ( 71 % ) <i> BRAF </i> mutants , including 4 with innate vemurafenib resistance , were sensitive to SCH772984 .
All three ( 100 % ) <i> BRAF @/@ NRAS </i> double mutants , 11 of 14 ( 78 % ) <i> NRAS </i> mutants and 5 of 7 ( 71 % ) wild-type melanomas were sensitive .
Among <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600 </i> </sup> mutants with <i> in vitro </i> acquired resistance to vemurafenib , those with MAPK pathway reactivation as the mechanism of resistance were sensitive to SCH772984 .
SCH772984 caused G1 arrest and induced apoptosis .
BRAF @-@ mutant melanoma cell lines are sensitive to ERK inhibition
Twenty @-@ one melanoma cell lines containing mutations in the <i> BRAF </i> gene were evaluated to determine sensitivity to SCH772984 ( ERKi ) .
As a comparison , sensitivity to vemurafenib was also determined .
<i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> was the most frequently observed BRAF mutation , present in 17 of 21 cell lines .
M381 contains <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600R </i> </sup> substitution , M414 contains <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600K </i> </sup> , M417 contains <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> G466E </i> </sup> and M420 contains <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> L597S </i> </sup> mutation .
Among the 21 cell lines , sensitivity to vemurafenib or SCH-772984 fell into 3 groups : highly sensitive ( 50 % inhibitory concentration , IC @<sub> 50 </sub> < 1 μM ) , intermediate sensitivity ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> 1 @–@ 2 μM ) and resistant ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> > 2 μM ) .
15 cell lines were highly sensitive to SCH-772984 with IC @<sub> 50 </sub> less than or equal to 1 μM . Of the 12 cell lines highly sensitive to vemurafenib , all contain <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> and were also sensitive to SCH-772984 .
Interestingly , M399 , M414 , M308 , and M409 were sensitive to SCH-772984 but only intermediately sensitive ( M399 , M409 and M414 ) or resistant ( M308 ) to vemurafenib .
With the exception of M414 , all non @-@ V600E mutants were resistant to both vemurafenib and SCH772984 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .
As a comparison , sensitivity to the MEKi trametinib segregated all cell lines into three different groups : highly sensitive ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> < 2 nM ) , intermediately sensitive ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> 2 @-@ 30 nM ) and resistant ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> > 30 nM ) ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1 ) .
In general , cell lines sensitive to SCH772984 were also sensitive to trametinib . @<fig id="Fig1"> <label> Figure 1 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> Effect of SCH-722984 on BRAF @-@ mutant melanoma cell lines .

We next determined a time @-@ course of SCH772984 on MAPK and PI3K @/@ AKT pathway signaling for M238 , a SCH772984 @-@ sensitive <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup>@ -@ mutant melanoma cell line and M233 , a SCH772984 @-@ resistant <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup>@ -@ mutant melanoma cell line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
For both M233 and M238 , treatment with 500 nM SCH772984 inhibited pRSK , a known ERK1 @/@ ERK2 downstream target , as well as pERK1 @/@ pERK2 itself .
For the resistant M233 , the MAPK inhibition was strong as early as 1 hour post treatment , with decreased pERK and near @-@ complete disappearance of pRSK .
However , between 12 and 24 hours we observe a rebound in the pathway with a return to baseline pERK1 @/@ pERK2 levels and an induction in pMEK above baseline levels by 24 hours .
Little change in pAKT was seen at any timepoint up to 24 hours , though a mild induction was seen at 48 hours .
For the sensitive M238 , pRSK levels also decreased as early as 1 hour and levels continued to decrease thereafter .
Meanwhile , pERK1 @/@ pERK2 remained suppressed through 24 hours .
By 48 hours , pERK1 @/@ pERK2 levels increased , though at reduced levels compared to baseline .
Concomitant with this , pMEK levels remained unchanged until 24 hours and increased further by 48 hours .
Regarding pAKT , an early induction at 1 hour occurred , followed by decreases thereafter though never becoming completely suppressed even at 48 hours .
In both cell lines , pRSK remained blocked at all timepoints , demonstrating ongoing , potent inhibition of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activity by SCH772984 .
These data supports that the distinction between sensitive and resistant cell lines could be best made based on pERK recovery at 24 hours , as recovery of the feedback loop that restores MAPK activity occurred by 24 hours in the resistant cell line whereas the sensitive cell line required longer than 24 hours .
Therefore , for subsequent analyses , we selected 24 hours as the optimal timepoint to compare signaling in our cell lines .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ C , three <i> BRAF </i> mutant cell lines representative of the different sensitivity groups to SCH772984 were profiled in terms of downstream signaling inhibition at 24 hours : a highly sensitive cell line ( M262 , <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> ) , an intermediately sensitive cell line ( M409 , <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> ) , and a resistant cell line ( M381 , <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600R </i> </sup> ) .
For M262 , treatment with SCH772984 resulted in disappearance of pRSK , disappearance of pERK1 @/@ pERK2 , decrease in pAKT , and slight induction of pMEK at 24 hours .
M409 had a similar cell signaling profile as M262 , consistent with its modest sensitivity .
For M381 induction of pMEK and pERK1 @/@ pERK2 were seen with no change in pRSK at 24 h .
To determine the effect of SCH772984 on the PI3K @/@ AKT pathway , we first evaluated the baseline pAKT levels for a group of cell lines ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) .
We found a weak correlation with the activity of the PI3K @/@ AKT pathway and sensitivity to SCH772984 for BRAF mutants .
For example , M238 and M409 are two clear examples of cell lines with low levels of pAKT related to sensitivity to SCH772984 .
For both of them , ERK inhibition with SCH772984 was accompanied by an upregulation of pAKT levels even at 24 hours treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
M233 was among the resistant <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> melanoma cell lines , which appeared to have increased pAKT at baseline compared to other <i> BRAF </i> mutant cell lines .
Consistent with this , M233 is a PTEN null cell line and has a concomitant <i> AKT1 </i> amplification [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"> 31 </xref>@ ] .
After treatment with SCH772984 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) , these levels stay constant , indicating that dual inhibition with SCH772984 and AKT @/@ mTOR inhibitors may be a useful strategy .
In contrast , M262 is an <i> AKT1 </i> amplified cell line [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"> 31 </xref>@ ] with high sensitivity to SCH772984 and vemurafenib .
Treatment of M262 with SCH772984 reduced both pERK1 @/@ pERK2 and pAKT levels , indicating blockade of the MAPK pathway and PI3K @/@ AKT pathway at the same time ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ C ) .
In general , the presence of <i> AKT1 </i> or <i> AKT2 </i> amplification did not preclude sensitivity to SCH772984 , as three of five such cell lines were highly sensitive to SCH772984 ( M229 , M249 , and M262 ) , one was intermediately sensitive ( M255 ) , and M233 and M308 were resistant ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .
Given high baseline pAKT levels were seen in some cells resistant to ERK inhibition ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) and the persistence of pAKT activity with SCH722984 treatment , we evaluated the effect of SCH772984 in combination with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 or the mTOR inhibitor MK-8669 .
The addition of either the AKTi or mTORi always resulted in more potent cell growth inhibition compared to ERKi alone ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figures S3A and 3B ) .
Combining SCH772984 with the mTOR inhibitor MK-8669 was particularly synergistic .
For BRAF @-@ mutant cell line M233 , both combinations resulted in more complete decrease in pERK compared to treatment with SCH772984 alone .
Despite the improved inhibition of the MAPK pathway , the levels of pAKT were largely unaffected by the addition of MK-2206 or MK-8669 ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figure S3C ) .
Potent SCH772984 @-@ mediated ERK inhibition in <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ wild type melanoma cell lines
Currently , there is no effective targeted therapy for <i> BRAF </i> wild-type melanoma , which comprises 50 % of all melanomas .
Fourteen <i> NRAS </i> mutant melanoma and seven cells lines with wild-type <i> BRA </i>@ F and <i> NRAS </i> were evaluated for SCH772984 sensitivity .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ A , while all <i> NRAS </i>@ -@ mutant cell lines were resistant to vemurafenib , 11 of 14 were highly sensitive to SCH772984 ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> < 1 μM ) .
Across the 11 NRAS sensitive cell lines , two of them were Q61L ( M296 and M311 ) , four were Q61K ( M408 , Sbcl2 , WM1366 , M245 and M244 ) , one was Q61H ( M243 ) and three were Q61R ( SKMEL173 , M296 and M412a ) .
Interestingly , the three cell lines with IC50 > 1 uM ( M202 , M207 and M318 ) were exclusively NRAS Q61L mutated .
Sensitivity to trametinib are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4"> 4 </xref>@ : Figures S4A and 4B for NRAS @-@ mutant and wild-type melanoma cell lines , respectively .
Consistent with the profile for sensitive cell lines , treatment with SCH772984 for the sensitive M408 resulted in decreased pRSK , disappearance of pERK1 @/@ pERK2 , and slight induction of pMEK , with no change in total RSK , MEK , ERK 1 @/@ 2 , or AKT .
For the resistant M202 , a modest induction of pMEK with some decrease in pERK and pRSK was observed at 24 hours ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ B ) .
Treatment with SCH772984 resulted in upregulation of pAKT levels for M408 and WM1366 ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figure S3C ) .
Consistent with the synergistic growth inhibition seen with combining SCH772984 and either MK-2206 or MK-8669 , pAKT levels were abrogated with the addition of MK-2206 ( AKT inhibitor ) and MK-8669 ( mTOR inhibitor ) ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figure S3A-C ) . @<fig id="Fig2"> <label> Figure 2 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> Susceptibility of NRAS @-@ mutant melanoma cell lines to SCH-722984 .

For <i> BRAF </i> and <i> NRAS </i> wild-type melanoma cell lines , all seven were sensitive to ERK inhibition , with six of seven highly sensitive to SCH772984 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ A ) , including M418 , which is a <i> KRAS </i> <sup> <i> G12A </i> </sup> mutant .
Consistent with this , treatment with SCH772984 in the highly sensitive M285 line resulted in complete disappearance of pRSK , decreased pERK1 @/@ pERK2 and induction of pMEK .
M257 , which is intermediately sensitive to SCH722984 , had near @-@ complete disappearance of pRSK , though pERK1 @/@ pERK2 was slightly induced at 24 hours .
Phospho @-@ MEK was also induced in treated cells .
No changes in pAKT with SCH772984 were seen in either M285 or M257 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
These data indicate that SCH772984 may be effective against a majority of <i> BRAF </i> wild-type cell lines including <i> NRAS </i> mutants and <i> BRAF @/@ NRA </i>@ S wild-type melanoma cell lines which remain dependent on the MAPK pathway for continued growth . @<fig id="Fig3"> <label> Figure 3 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> Susceptibility of BRAF @/@ NRAS wild-type melanoma to SCH-722984 .

SCH722984 is effective in <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ mutant melanoma with acquired vemurafenib @-@ resistance
The IC @<sub> 50 </sub> of SCH722984 or vemurafenib was next determined in eight <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ mutant vemurafenib @-@ resistant melanoma cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ A ) .
M376 and M398 , two <i> BRAF @/@ NRAS </i> double mutant cell lines derived from the same patient tumors , were highly sensitive to SCH722984 , despite high resistance to vemurafenib .
M376 is a spontaneously arising double mutant , whereas M398 was established from tumor from the same patient upon progression on vemurafenib .
Similar to their isogenic parental cell lines , potent growth inhibition with SCH772984 was also seen for three <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutant melanoma cell lines with <i> in vitro </i>@ -@ derived vemurafenib resistance ( polyclonal population ) : M395AR , M397AR , and M249AR4 .
Previously data demonstrated that these cell lines reactivate the MAPK pathway via generation of BRAF splice variants ( M395AR and M397AR ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7"> 7 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24"> 24 </xref>@ ] , or via secondary <i> NRAS </i> mutation ( M249AR4 ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"> 6 </xref>@ ] .
In contrast , M229AR9 , M238AR2 and M409AR1 remained highly resistant to SCH722984 with IC50 s > 2 uM .
For M229AR9 and M238AR2 upregulation of RTK is the mechanism of vemurafenib resistance [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"> 6 </xref>@ ] .
The mechanism of resistance for M409AR is unknown at this time , and studies are ongoing to delineate the mechanism underlying BRAFi @-@ resistance . @<fig id="Fig4"> <label> Figure 4 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> SCH722984 in BRAF @-@ mutant melanoma cell lines with vemurafenib @-@ acquired resistance .

Effect of SCH722984 on MAPK signaling .
Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of 24 hour exposure to 500 nM SCH&22984 ( + ) or DMSO ( - ) on phospho @- or total MEK , ERK 1 @/@ 2 , RSK , AKT or beta-actin as loading control . </p> </caption> <graphic /> </fig>
Consistent with the signaling for other sensitive cell lines , all three <i> BRAF @/@ NRAS </i> double mutants ( M376 , M398 , M249AR4 ) displayed decreased pRSK and pERK1 @/@ pERK2 at 24 hours with no detectable change in pMEK .
In the paired parental and acquired @-@ resistance cell lines , treatment of the parental cell lines ( M397 , M249 , M229 , M238 and M409 ) with SCH722984 resulted in disappearance of pRSK , decrease in pERK1 @/@ pERK2 .
Interestingly , we observed again upregulation of pAKT levels after treatment with SCH772984 in M398 , M376 , M397AR , M249AR4 , and M409AR1 , suggesting a rapid upregulation of the PI3K @/@ AKT @/@ mTOR pathway .
This suggests that dual inhibition with SCH772984 and an AKT or mTOR inhibitor may result in more potent growth inhibition .
For M397AR and M249AR4 , the disappearance of pERK was robust .
In contrast , for the resistant M229AR9 , M238AR2 and M409AR1 , though treatment with SCH772984 resulted in disappearance of pRSK , pMEK appeared to be induced and pERK1 @/@ pERK2 remained almost unchanged ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ B ) .
Synergistic inhibition with combination BRAF and ERK inhibition
We next determined whether combining BRAF and ERK inhibition could result in synergistic inhibition by dual MAPK pathway inhibition .
Treatment of M238 and M792 , two <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup>@ -@ mutant melanoma cell lines highly sensitive to singular treatment with vemurafenib and SCH772984 , with equimolar concentrations of combined vemurafenib and SCH772984 treatment resulted in potent synergistic growth inhibition with IC @<sub> 50 </sub> of 10 nM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ A , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ B ) .
Combining vemurafenib with SCH772984 resulted in a more profound decrease in pRSK and pERK for the highly sensitive M262 and M792 lines compared to untreated controls or treatment with either agent alone .
M262 resulted in decreased pAKT levels after all three treatments .
For M308 , which is resistant to vemurafenib and sensitive to SCH772984 , as pRSK was already completely absent with treatment with SCH772984 alone , no additional effect of the combination was apparent ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ C ) .
Interestingly , at 24 hours post treatment , induction of pMEK and pERK was already seen , indicating rapid feedback recovery for M308 , despite its sensitivity to SCH772984 .
A slight decrease in pERK1 @/@ pERK2 was seen with SCH772984 treatment , with a compensatory increase in pMEK .
The generally more resistant M308 and M370 lines , in contrast to the generally more sensitive M262 and M792 lines , did not show a decrease in pMEK when combining the two drugs , which seems to be due to the lack of activity of vemurafenib in these resistant cells .
No additive effect from the dual upstream blockade could be noticed in the immediate downstream targets , indicating that the pathway remained active ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ C ) .
All cell lines sensitive to BRAFi were also sensitive to the combination .
Four intermediately sensitive cell lines to BRAFi became highly sensitive to the combination , with improved pathway inhibition compared to ERK inhibition alone in all cases .
More importantly , highly resistant cell lines to BRAFi became sensitive ( M420 , M308 , M410 ) or intermediately sensitive ( M417 , M370 , M229AR , M409AR1 ) to the combination .
Three remained resistant but with a slightly improved IC @<sub> 50 . </sub> C.I.s demonstrated synergy with combined BRAF and ERK inhibition for all cell lines except M308 , in which dual treatment with vemurafenib and SCH772984 is only additive ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ D ) . @<fig id="Fig5"> <label> Figure 5 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> Susceptibility of </bold> <bold> <i> BRAF </i> </bold> <bold> mutant melanoma cell lines to MAPK inhibitors . </bold>

We next examined whether cells inherently resistant to BRAFi could be sensitive to a MEK inhibitor ( MEKi ) or ERKi .
Sensitivity of <i> BRAF </i> mutant melanoma cell lines to BRAFi predicted sensitivity to MEK and ERK inhibitors .
Furthermore , 10 cell lines inherently resistant to BRAFi were often sensitive to MEK and ERK inhibition , and cell lines resistant to BRAFi or MEKi were relatively more sensitive to SCH722984 .
Indeed , combining BRAF with ERK inhibition potently decreased the equimolar IC @<sub> 50 </sub> of all cell lines and resulted in synergy in all but one case ( M308 ) , including M255 , M399 and M420 , which are completely resistant to individual inhibitors ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ D ) .
Because the combination on BRAF combined with MEK inhibition is currently FDA approved for <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600 </i> </sup> mutant melanoma , we also determined the IC @<sub> 50 </sub> for the combination of vemurafenib and trametinib .
The results showed potent growth inhibition and synergy in all cell lines .
Sensitivity to the vemurafenib + trametinib combination generally overlapped with sensitivity to the vemurafenib + SCH722984 combination ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ D ) , consistent with the idea that both combinations cause dual MAPK blockade .
The growth curves for the vemurafenib + trametinib combinations are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5"> 5 </xref>@ : Figure S5 .
Effects of MAPK pathway inhibition on cell cycle progression and apoptosis
To determine the effect of BRAF or ERK inhibition on cell cycle progression and apoptosis , cells were treated with SCH772984 , alone or in combination with vemurafenib for 48 hours then stained with DAPI and intracellularly for cleaved PARP and analyzed by flow cytometry .
Treatment with either of these two inhibitors resulted in an increase in the sub @-@ G0 population , the G1 population , as well as an increase in cleaved PARP levels which indicates apoptotic cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6"> 6 </xref>@ A ) .
A modest increase of 3 @-@ 10 % was seen in the sub @-@ G0 population for all cell lines treated with vemurafenib , SCH772984 or the combination .
The amount of subG1 increase did not correlate with sensitivity or resistance to the MAPK pathway inhibitors .
In contrast , for the G0 @-@ G1 populations , there was a correlation with sensitivity , with an up to 40 % increase in G0 @-@ G1 population seen in the sensitive cell lines M238 and M792 , while the resistant cell lines M233 and M299 demonstrated only a 10 % increase in the G0 @-@ G1 population for the combination treatment .
Concomitant with the increase in G0 @-@ G1 , a decreased proportion of cells were observed in S-phase , with the largest decreases of over 20 % seen in the sensitive cell lines M792 and M238 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6"> 6 </xref>@ B ) .
Treatment of the sensitive cell lines , M238 and M792 , with SCH772984 alone or in combination with vemurafenib resulted in a dramatic increase in cleaved PARP reaching induced percentages around 40 @-@ 50 % .
In comparison , the resistant cell lines ( M233 and M299 ) had cleaved PARP at 20 @-@ 25 % ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6"> 6 </xref>@ C ) .
With the exception of M299 , a statistically significant increase in cleaved PARP was seen in all cell lines treated with SCH772984 , or the combination of SCH772984 and vemurafenib , compared to vemurafenib alone .
Combinatorial treatment offered a statistically significant increase in cleaved PARP compared to vemurafenib alone in all cell lines ( 20 % increase in sensitive cell lines and 10 % increase in resistant cell lines compared to vemurafenib alone ) .
However only a trend towards increased cleaved PARP fractions was observed comparing combinatorial treatment with SCH772984 alone without reaching statistical significance . @<fig id="Fig6"> <label> Figure 6 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> Effect of SCH722984 , vemurafenib or the combination on cell cycle progression and apoptosis in BRAF @-@ mutant melanoma cell lines . </bold>

To address whether there are differences in MEK inhibition or ERK inhibition on apoptosis , we performed cell cycle analysis on three melanoma cell lines with distinct sensitivity profile to SCH772984 : M263 ( sensitive ) , M255 ( intermediately sensitive ) and M370 ( resistant ) .
All three cell lines demonstrated good synergy for the combination of vemurafenib and SCH772984 .
Cell lines treated with SCH772984 or the combination of vemurafenib + SCH772984 had the highest levels of cleaved PARP .
In comparison , trametinib , did not induce the same levels of apoptosis in any case .
In terms of effects on the cell cycle , G0 @-@ G1 arrest was maximally induced by ERK inhibition also ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6"> 6 </xref>@ : Figure S6 ) .
This data support the potent activity of SCH772984 both as a single agent and in combination .
Combining BRAF and ERK inhibition delays the development of resistance
Given the potent synergistic inhibition seen when combining vemurafenib and SCH772984 , we hypothesized that chronic exposure to dual inhibition would significantly delay the development of resistance compared to either single agent alone .
To test this hypothesis , long term cultures were established in 96 @-@ well plates to allow both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the effect of each drug alone or their combination on M238 and M792 , which are highly sensitive to both inhibitors and for which dual therapy was highly synergistic ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7"> 7 </xref>@ A ) .
Treatment with 500 nM vemurafenib initially suppressed growth of M238 and M792 , however , by 42 days of treatment , several wells were confluent and cells had normal morphology , indicating development of BRAFi @-@ resistance .
In contrast , very few cells were seen in plates treated with ERKi alone or in combination at 42 days ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7"> 7 </xref>@ B ) .
For ERKi @-@ treated M792 plates , confluent wells were not seen until 84 days .
When cell viability was quantified at day 44 for BRAFi @-@ treated cells , over 90 % of the wells had > 10,000 viable cells .
In contrast , many fewer viable cells were seen for M792 treated with ERKi alone or in combination with BRAFi measured at day 84 .
Only 20 % of the wells treated with ERKi alone and < 5 % of wells treated with the combination had > 10,000 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7"> 7 </xref>@ C ) .
For M238 , similar data were seen , though in this case , treatment with 500 nM ERKi alone delayed the development of resistance until 140 days .
Most strikingly , for M238 , 280 days , twice that for SCH772984 alone , were required for resistance to the combination of vemurafenib and SCH772984 to develop ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7"> 7 </xref>@ D ) .
Taken together , these data provide preliminary <i> in vitro </i> evidence that SCH772984 may more potently and more durably inhibit <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ mutant melanoma compared to single agent vemurafenib , and that the combination of BRAF and ERK inhibition results in better inhibition than either alone .
These data are intriguing and should be further validated <i> in vivo </i>@ . @<fig id="Fig7"> <label> Figure 7 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> Effect of combined MAPK inhibition on long-term melanoma cultures . </bold>

We present a model in which activation of the MAPK cascade signals via c-fos @/@ c-jun family members to activate alpha 2 integrin gene expression .
In addition , constitutive activation of the pathway via expression of the constitutively active mutants of MAPKK1 or MAPKK2 induced the expression of the platelet @/@ megakaryocytic @-@ specific genes alpha IIb and eta 3 .
Using these methods , we found that JAK2 was essential for signal transduction but that loss of TYK2 made no appreciable difference in tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules , including Mpl , STAT3 , and Shc ( 33 ) ..... In fact , tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs and DNA binding assays seem to be almost interchangeable measures of transcriptional activity .
It has been difficult to interpret the physiologic role of STAT signaling in megakaryocyte development . In multiple cell lines it was reported that TPO induced activation of both STAT3 and STAT5 ( 5A and 5B ) ( 26 , 28 ? 30 , 37 , 38 ) .... However , when purified murine megakaryocyte extracts were examined , we found that STAT3 was much more pronounced in both tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity than STAT5 ( 32 )
Activation of MEK1 and MEK2 involves phosphorylation upon conserved serine residues ( Ser-218 and Ser-222 on MEK1 , Ser-222 and Ser-226 on MEK2
c-Cbl is tyrosine @-@ phosphorylated , binds to Fyn upon insulin stimulation , and is translocated to small invaginations of the plasma membrane , called caveolae , after insulin stimulation
Insulin and IGF-1 stimulation also promote association between IRS-1 and aVb3 integrin ( vitronectin receptor )
Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , the class of insulin sensitizers that act through the nuclear receptor PPAR-g , increase CAP expression levels and c-Cbl phosphorylation significantly in adipocytes ( 54 ) , possibly contributing to their insulin sensitizing effect
Interestingly , this NPXY sequence is also a receptor internalization motif found in many members of the tyrosine kinase receptor family , the low @-@ density lipoprotein receptor ( 11 @-@ 13 ) , and the transferrin receptor ( 14 ) , all of which are internalized in a ligand @-@ dependent fashion .
Csk has been reported to associate with IRS-1 through its SH2 domain and promote dephosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) in an insulin @-@ dependent manner ( 56 ) .
In smooth muscle cells , blocking ligand occupancy of aVb3 integrin reduces IGF-1 @-@ induced IRS-1 phosphorylation
Nck associates with IRS-1 ( 45 ) , many different tyrosine kinases , several serine @/@ threonine kinases through its SH2 domain , as well as Sos through its SH3 domains
Gab-1 is heavily phosphorylated by the epidermal growth factor receptor , but poorly by the insulin receptor
Recently , it was shown that Fyn is one of the kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of caveolin
It also contains an additional binding site located in the phosphorylated kinase activation loop of the insulin receptor but is only very slightly phosphorylated by insulin receptor .
Crk has been reported to associate with tyrosine @-@ phosphorylated proteins , such as p130Cas and paxillin ( 42 , 43 ) , involved in the rearrangement of cytoskeletal components , through its SH2 domain .
c-Cbl associated protein ( CAP ) that has three sequential SH3 domains is specifically expressed in insulin @-@ responsive cell types and associates with both c @- Cbl and the insulin receptor
Recently , phosphorylated p62 dok was demonstrated to associate with the GTPase @-@ activating protein ( GAP ) for Ras .
In the case of insulin , it is unclear whether SHIP associates with IRS proteins or the insulin receptor , although a recent report has demonstrated SHIP association with IRS-2 in response to erythropoietin
The SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Grb @- 2 and the SH2 domain of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 bind other sequences , including pYVNI , pYIDL , and pYASI sequences ( 1 ) .
Since an inhibitor against SERCA induces apoptosis in some cell lines ( 76 ) , the IRS @/@ SERCA complex might be involved in an insulin and IGF-1 @-@ dependent antiapoptotic effect .
Grb @-@ IR is a recently discovered SH2 domain protein that may translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and bind directly to the tyrosine @-@ phosphorylated insulin receptor
The physiological substrates for SHP @- 2 are not known , but overexpression of SHP-2 modulates cell adhesion and migration , as well as insulin activation of the Ras @/@ MAP-kinase pathway Several isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins ( b , e , and z ) have also been shown to associate with IRS-1 , presumably through one of the several RXRXXpS motifs of IRS-1 .
TNF-a appears to impair insulin signaling by increasing serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 . Serine @-@ phosphorylated IRS-1 inhibits insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity , which leads to impaired downstream signaling
other SH2 proteins , such as Crk ( adaptor ) , Nck ( adaptor ) , Fyn ( tyrosine kinase ) , and Csk ( tyrosine kinase ) , bind to tyrosine residues on IRS proteins through their specific SH2 domains .
Fyn is not activated directly by the insulin receptor , but rather by interaction with IRS-1 ( 49 ) and another insulin receptor substrate , c-Cbl ( 50 ) .
Recently , b1 integrins have also been reported to enhance IRS-1 phosphorylation and interaction , but not glucose transport , with downstream molecules such as PI3-kinase and Akt ( 74 ) . These results suggest that integrins and insulin @/@ IGF-1 receptor signaling pathways converge at an early point in the signaling cascade around the IRS proteins .
PC-1 is a membrane glycoprotein with ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase activity that seems to act as an intrinsic inhibitor of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity
It has been reported that PC-1 overexpression in skeletal muscle of obese subjects explains downregulation of insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation
Inhibition of MEK1 also led to reduced expression of alpha-enolase , phosphoglycerate kinase , elongation factor 2 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A3 , the latter two being detected as truncated proteins .
In support of these data , we also show that MEK1 is highly phosphorylated in vivo on Ser 217 @/@ 221 in MLK3 @-@ transformed fibroblasts
expression of MLK3 strongly activated SAPK ? to the same extent seen with the established JNK @/@ SAPK activator arsenite ( 45 )
Using a coupled assay , we were able to show that MLK3 @-@ mediated phosphorylation of SEK1 resulted in activation because GST @-@ SEK1 is able to phosphorylate recombinant SAPK ? ( Fig. 5D )
Wild type , but not KD , MLK3 was able to phosphorylate His @-@ MEK1 ( Fig. 5A ) ? and GST @-@ SEK1 ( Fig. 5B ) ? in vitro .
Thrombin receptor mediated signal transduction could induce the expressions of IL6 and G-CSF , and increase inflammatory events in the cavum articulare via NF-kappa B activation
Thrombin receptor mediated signal transduction could induce the expressions of IL6 and G-CSF , and increase inflammatory events in the cavum articulare via NF-êB activation
The levels of IL6 and of G-CSF mRNAs showed a time dependent increase during two to eight hours after thrombin stimulation .... Cytokines were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) in the supernatants of cultured rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts stimulated by thrombin
Thrombin receptor mediated signal transduction could induce the expressions of IL6 and G-CSF , and increase inflammatory events in the cavum articulare via NF-êB activation
Induction of the urokinase promoter by HGF @/@ SF via the Met receptor was blocked by co-expression of a dominant @-@ negative Grb2 and Sos1 expression construct .
Further , the expression of the catalytically inactive mutants of Ha-Ras , RhoA , c-Raf , and Erk2 or addition of the Mek1 @-@ specific inhibitor PD 098059 abrogated the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by HGF @/@ SF .
c-Raf-1 kinase was identified as an intracellular target of a signal transduction cascade initiated by binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR-I .
Gadd45 was also able to physically interact with Cdc2 , but not Cyclin B1 . Addition of Gadd45 to immunoprecipitated Cdc2 @/@ Cyclin B1 in vitro led to a dissociation of this complex , and thus may represent a new checkpoint mechanism whereby Cdc2 @/@ Cyclin B1 can be inhibited .
Treatment with TNF-a significantly decreased the intracellular GSH content of HS-24 cells . Pretreatment of this culture with DMSO recovered the TNF-a @-@ induced decrease in GSH ( Table 1 ) .
TNF-a ( 200 U @/@ ml ) significantly increased the levels of IL-6 mRNA in HS-24 cells and DMSO ( 1.0 % ) markedly reduced those induced with the cytokine ( Fig. 5E ) .
An XO enzyme activity of 5.0 mU @/@ ml led to a twofold increase in IL-6 secretion in NHBE cells . And incubation of HS-24 cells with XO ( 20 mU @/@ ml ) induced a 1.8 @-@ fold increase in IL-6 production
SOD ( 250 U @/@ ml ) significantly suppressed the IL-6 production and IL-6 mRNA expression induced by XO , whereas catalase ( 500 U @/@ ml ) did not modulate the IL-6 response to XO ( Fig. 4 ) .
TNF-a significantly increased the production of IL-6 in WI-38 @-@ 40 cells . However , DMSO was not able to inhibit the TNF-a @-@ induced IL-6 enhancement in both protein and mRNA levels ( Fig. 7 ) . These results suggest that ROIs may not be involved in the production of IL-6 in human lung fibroblasts
TNF-a was dose dependently capable of inducing IL-6 release from NHBE and HS-24 cells ( Fig. 5 , A and C ) .
As shown in Fig. 3A , stimulation with XO resulted in a significant increase in the levels of IL-6 at 12 and 24 h compared with those with 0.7 mM X alone ( P , 0.0001 ) . Consistent with these protein data , stimulation of HS-24 cells with XO caused the maximum elevation in IL-6 mRNAlevels at 6 h , whereas XO did not modulate control GAPDH transcript levels ( Fig. 3B ) .
TNF-a significantly increased the production of IL-6 in WI-38 @-@ 40 cells . However , DMSO was not able to inhibit the TNF-a @-@ induced IL-6 enhancement in both protein and mRNA levels ( Fig. 7 ) . These results suggest that ROIs may not be involved in the production of IL-6 in human lung fibroblasts
TNF-a was dose dependently capable of inducing IL-6 release from NHBE and HS-24 cells ( Fig. 5 , A and C ) .
Northern blot analysis documented that two transcription factor genes chosen for further study , c-myc promoter @-@ binding protein ( MBP-1 ) and X-box binding protein 1 ( XBP-1 ) , were up-regulated in U266 cells about 3 @-@ fold relative to the cell cycle @-@ dependent beta-actin gene 12 h after IL-6 treatment .
Signaling by the IL-6 receptor is mediated through the signal transducing subunit gp130 and involves the activation of Janus @-@ associated kinases ( JAKs ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) , and mitogen @-@ activated protein ( MAP ) kinase .
Signaling by the IL-6 receptor is mediated through the signal transducing subunit gp130 and involves the activation of Janus @-@ associated kinases ( JAKs ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) , and mitogen @-@ activated protein ( MAP ) kinase .
This study shows that in hepatoma cells , the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 , but not SHC , is the primary signaling event associated with the activation of MAP kinases ( ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ) by gp130 .
<A4> c-Abl binds to p53 in response to 1-b-d-arabinofuransylcytosine or methylmethanesulfonate ( Yuan et al. , 1996 ) ; this interaction does not require c-Abl kinase activity . Moreover , c-Abl kinase activity does not require p53 . Binding of c-Abl to p53 inhibits the Mdm2 @-@ mediated degradation of p53 ( Sionov et al. , 1999 ) .
<B8> c-Abl phosphorylates DNA @-@ PK in the C-terminal region ( amino acids 3414 ? 3850 ) ( Jin et al. , 1997 ) . c-Abl @-@ dependent phosphorylation of DNA @-@ PK is stimulated by IR ( Kharbanda et al. , 1997 ) . c-Abl does not phosphorylate Ku ( Kharbanda et al. , 1997 ) .
<N12> Rad51 binds to c-Abl directly ( Yuan et al. , 1998 ) . c-Abl phosphorylates Rad51 Tyr54 , as a consequence of which the binding of Rad51 to ssDNA is inhibited ( Yuan et al. , 1998 ) . IR induces c-Abl @-@ dependent phosphorylation of Rad51 ( Yuan et al. , 1998 ) .
<p30> p53 is rapidly degraded by the process of ubiquitiation and proteasome . <p31> mdm2 stimulates p53 degradation
<A8> c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is blocked by pRb , which binds to the c-Abl kinase domain ( Welch and Wang , 1995 ) .
<s10> Cyclin A : Cdk2 and Cyclin A : Cdc2 phosphorylate RPA2 ; the major site for Cdc2 has been mapped to Ser29 ( Niu et al. , 1997 ) .
<r11> Cyclin D binds PCNA directly and inhibits PCNA @-@ dependent replication ( Matsuoka et al. , 1994 ; Pagano et al. , 1994 ) .
<r2> DPase a-primase may be regulated by phosphorylation of its p68 subunit by Cyclin A : Cdk2 , which reduces and Cyclin E : Cdk2 which increases its DNA initiation activity ( Voitenleitner et al. , 1999 ) .
<C13> Cyclin E has a half-life of ~ 30 min . It is degraded by way of the ubiquitin ? proteasome pathway subsequent to phosphorylation ( possibly autophosphorylation ) at threonine-380 ( Clurman et al. , 1996 ; Won and Reed , 1996 ) . However , it can be stabilized by binding to Cdk2 .
<C40> Ser216 @-@ phosphorylated Cdc25C is recognized and bound by 14-3-3 protein family members ( Peng et al. , 1997 , 1998 ) . Ser216 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding probably sequester Cdc25C and thus prevent it from interacting with Cdk1 in vivo ( Peng et al. , 1997 ) . 14 @-@ 3 @-@ 3s is localized to the cytoplasm and may be the means by which Cdc25C is sequestered outside of the nucleus ( Hermeking et al. , 1997 ) .
<C36> Cdc25C is activated by hyperphosphorylation of the Nterminal domain ( Gabrielli et al. , 1997 ) , which can be phosphorylated by Cyclin B : Cdk1 ( Hoffman et al. , 1993 ) .
<E14> The interaction with HDAC1 enhances transcriptional repression by pocket proteins ( Brehm et al. , 1998 ; Ferreira et al. , 1998 ; Luo et al. , 1998 ) . HDAC1:RB1^taof ( RB1 ) HDAC1:NOLC1^taof ( RB1 ) HDAC1:RBL1^taof ( RB1 )
<B10> HMG1 or 2 competes with Ku for binding to DNA @-@ PK and stimulates DNA @-@ dependent kinase activity in vitro in the absence of Ku ( Yumoto et al. , 1998 ) .
<B4> The kinase activity of DNA @-@ PK is stimulated by binding to dsDNA ends ; however , the stimulation is greater in the complex with Ku ( Yaneva et al. , 1997 ; West et al. , 1998 ) .
<E16> pRb binds and activates C/EBP ( Chen et al. , 1996a , b ) . The binding of C/EBP to its DNA recognition elements is enhanced .
<s7> The binding of RPA to p53 inhibits the binding of RPA to ssDNA ( Dutta et al. , 1993 ) and the binding of p53 to its promoter sites ( Miller et al. , 1997 ) .
<E27> p107 inhibits Sp1 @-@ dependent transcription . Binding of p107 to Sp1 seems to inhibit the binding of Sp1 to DNA ( Datta et al. , 1995 ) .
<p17> Ser392 phosphorylation of P53 increases 10 @-@ fold the association constant for tetramerization , but this effect is reversed by Ser315 phosphorylation . The tetramerization activates P53 for specific DNA binding and transcription
<p10> PKC phosphorylates P53 at Serine378 <p11> The Cdk7:CycH : p36 ( CAK ) component of TFIIH phosphorylates p53 at sites which may include 372,376 , 378 , 392 [ serine residues ]
<A7> c-Abl binds and tyrosine phosphorylates paxillin in an adhesion @-@ dependent manner ( Lewis and Schwartz , 1998 ) .
<A2> ATM phosphorylates c-Abl on Ser465 and thereby activates the kinase ( Baskaran et al. , 1997b ) . <A3> Phosphorylation by ATM activates c-Abl ( Baskaran et al. , 1997b ) . c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is stimulated in response to ionizing radiation ( IR ) , 1-b-d-arabinofuransylcytosine , camptothecin , or etoposide ( Yuan et al. , 1996 , 1998 ) .
<C39> Cdc25C Ser216 also binds and is phosphorylated by CTAK1 ( Peng et al. , 1998 ) . Cdc25C Ser216 is phosphorylated throughout interphase but not in mitosis ( Peng et al. , 1997 ) .
<C41> Cyclin B is degraded late in mitosis through the ubiquitin @-@ protein ligase ( E3 ) activity of the anaphase @-@ promoting complex , which is probably activated by phosphorylation by Plk1 ( Glover et al. , 1998 ) .
<C37> The Cdc25C N-terminal domain can also be phosphorylated by Plk1 ( Hamanaka et al. , 1994 ) . During mitosis , Plk1 , by way of its polo boxes , localizes progressively to the centromeres , spindle poles , centrosomes , and spindle midzone or midbody ( Glover et al. , 1998 ; Lee et al. , 1998c ) .
<B5> DNA @-@ PK phosphorylates itself , thereby blocking its interaction with Ku : DNA complex and inhibiting its kinase activity ; it also phosphorylates Ku70 . Ku80 , but without effect ( Chan and Lees @-@ Miller , 1996 ) .
<C27> p45Skp2 inhibits Cdk2 kinase activity and blocks phosphorylation of Cdk2 by Wee1 or CAK ( Yam et al. , 1999 ) . Similarly to p21Cip1 , two molecules of p45Skp2 seem to be required to inhibit Cdk2 . Binding to p45Skp2 is mutually exclusive with p21 cip1 .
<C17> Phosphorylation of Thr14 or Tyr15 in Cdk1 reduces kinase activity 10 @-@ fold ; phosphorylation of both sites reduces activity 100 @-@ fold ( Liu et al. , 1997 ) .
<C21> p27Kip1 can be phosphorylated by Cyclin E @- or Cyclin A @-@ dependent kinases and thereby may be targeted for degradation ( Sheaff et al. , 1997 ) .
<C9> Cyclin D1 has a short half-life ( , 30 min ) , regardless of whether free or Cdk4 @-@ bound . Rapid degradation of Cyclin D1 requires phosphorylation at threonine-286 ( kinase unknown , but not Cdk2 or Cdk4 ) ; degradation is by way of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( Diehl et al. , 1997 ) .
<C11b> DMTF1 activates transcription from the p19ARF promoter and induces cell cycle arrest and p21Cip1 accumulation in a p19ARF @- and p53 @-@ dependent manner ( Inoue et al. , 1999 ) . Another DMTF1 @-@ regulated gene is CD13 @/@ aminopeptidase N , which is activated cooperatively by DMTF1 and c-Myb ; its activation by DMTF1 is inhibited by cyclin D independent of Cdk4 @/@ Cdk6 .
<h5> p300 binds to the transactivation domain of E2F1 ( Lee et al. , 1998a ) . E2F1 and p53 may be reciprocally regulated by their mutual dependence on coactivation by limiting amounts of p300 ( Lee et al. , 1998a ) .
<p24> P300 coactivates P53 @-@ activated promotors , including p21 , Bax , and Mdm2 . <p25> P300 binds the transactivation domain in the Nterminal region of p53 - this interaction is involved in the coactivation of p53 by p300
<p52> HMG1 binds p53 and enhances p53 binding to DNA , asl well as p53 @-@ mediated transcriptional activation
<r8> PCNA binds DNA ligase I ; the complex may function to join Okazaki fragments during DNA replication ( Levin et al. , 1997 ) .
Max blocks transcriptional activation from the E-cadherin promoter by c-Myc , presumably because it blocks the binding between c-Myc and AP2 .
<p29> mdm2 inhibits p53 @-@ mediated transactivation ; it inhibits the expression of p53 dependent genes
<A9> Phosphorylation of pRb disrupts the c-Abl : pRb complex and releases active c-Abl ( Welch and Wang , 1995 ) .
<E21> The p107 promoter contains E2F recognition elements and can be repressed by pRb or p107 ( Zhu et al. , 1995 ) .
<r4> Clamp @-@ loader RF-C loads PCNA onto the DNA ( Kelman , 1997 ) . RF-C interacts with the C-terminal side of PCNA ( Mossi et al. , 1997 ) .
<s16> DNA @-@ PK can bind to RPA ( Shao et al. , 1999 ) . <s17> Phosphorylation of RPA2 by DNA @-@ PK impairs the binding of RPA to DNA @-@ PK ( Shao et al. , 1999 ) .
<C29> p19Skp1 , through its F-box motif , may link Cyclin A to the ubiquitin ? proteasome protein degradation device ( Bai et al. , 1996 ) .
<p4> Unknown Phosphatase dephosphorylates P53 at Thr18 <p5> Phosphorylation of Ser18 ( note discrepancy with Thr18 above ) prevents stable binding of p53 to Mdm2 - other sites may be involved in this process
<s18> KARP1 stimulates DNA @-@ PK activity and may function in complex with DNA @-@ PK and Ku ( Mysung et al. , 1997 ; Myung et al. , 1998 ) ( also see P50 ) .
In the case of Cdk1 , these inhibitory phosphorylations are removed by dual @-@ action phosphatase Cdc25C , which is in turn activated by phosphorylations ( C18 ) introduced by mammalian polo @-@ like kinase 1 ( Plk1 ) ( C37 ) and @/@ or Cdk1 ( C36 ) . Cdc25C can be phosphorylated at Ser216 by Chk1 ( C38 ) or C-TAK1 ( C39 ) . Ser216 phosphorylation generates a binding site for 14-3-3 , and this binding inhibits the phosphatase ( C40 ) .
<C18> Dephosphorylation of Cdk1 Thr14 and Tyr15 sites is carried out by Cdc25C , which must itself be activated by phosphorylation in its N-terminal domain ( Jackman and Pines , 1997 ) . Cdc25C activity is high in mitosis during mitosis and low during interphase .
<C35> Cdc25A may be transcriptionally activated by c-Myc ; the Myc : Max heterodimer binds to elements in the Cdc25A gene and activates its transcription ( Galaktionov et al. , 1996 ) .
<C1> The Cyclin D1 promoter is activated by E2F4 , but it is repressed by E2F1 via pRb ( Watanabe et al. , 1998 ) . In pRb deficient cells , E2F1 stimulates this promoter . An Sp1 site close to the E2F element also participates in the regulation . ( Overexpression of pRb can increase the expression of Cyclin D1 by an unknown mechanism [ Watanabe et al. , 1998 ] . )
<E15> E2F @-@ regulated genes include many that are involved in cell cycle progression and control . Individual genes are differently regulated . Dyhydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) is activated via the E2F transactivation domain , whereas B-myb , Cyclin E , E2F-1 , E2F-2 , and Cdc2 are regulated via the repression domain of pRb family proteins ( Dyson , 1998 ) .
<r12> p53 binds and transiently transactivates the PCNA promoter ( when p53 reaches high levels , transactivation seems to stop ) ( Shivakumar et al. , 1995 ; Morris et al. , 1996 ; Xu and Morris , 1999 ) .
<p2> ATM phosphorylates P53 at Ser15
<p6> DNA @-@ PK phosphorylates P53 at Ser15 and Ser37 dependent on DNA double-strand ends
<p47> p53 binds BRCA1 . This binding enhances the transcriptional activity of P53
<C31> Cyclin D : Cdk4 phosphorylates pRb at a subset of sites , P ( D ) , but this does not suffice to abrogate the inhibition of E2F . <C32> Cyclin E : Cdk2 phosphorylates pRb at additional sites , P ( E ) , after the Cyclin D : Cdk4 @-@ specific sites have been phosphorylated . ( Cyclin E , in addition to acting on pRb , has actions that can induce S phase independent of pRb [ Lukas et al. , 1997 ; Lundberg and Weinberg , 1998 ] . )
NO modulation of the signaling pathway was shown by its inhibitory effect on shear stress @-@ induced ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation and activity .
Treatment of ECs with an NO donor , S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine ( SNAP ) or 3 @-@ morpholinosydnonimine ( SIN-1 ) , inhibited this shear stress @-@ induced Egr-1 expression .
The FAK and Fyn @/@ Shc pathways . Integrins activate various protein tyrosine kinases , including focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , Srcfamily kinases , and Abl , and a serine @-@ threonine kinase , integrin @-@ linked kinase ( ILK ) ( 4 , 7 ) .
( 38 ) . Integrins also stimulate the p70 S6 @- kinase , which may promote cyclin D1 translation ( 39 ) . Finally , anchorage to the ECM is necessary for the down-regulation of the Cdk 2 inhibitors p21 and p27 and , thus , the activation of cyclin E-Cdk 2
PTP @-@ PEST has a COOH-terminal extension that anchors it to the cytosolic aspect of the endoplasmic reticulum . Integrin @-@ mediated adhesion activates calpain , a protease that cleaves this extension and allows the phosphatase to relocate to focal adhesions ( 21 ) .
Whereas FAK is phosphorylated on tyrosine upon assembly of focal adhesions , it becomes phosphorylated on serine and disassociates from Src and p130CAS during mitosis ( 14 ) . These events may loosen cell @-@ substrate contacts and allow cells to divide and move apart .
Certain integrins may regulate proliferation by additional mechanisms . For example , the a6b1 integrin may in part promote exit from the cell cycle in myoblasts , because the cytoplasmic domain of a6 inhibits paxillin signaling ( 44 ) .
For example , avb3 associates with the PDGF receptor , and fibroblasts show greater proliferation in response to PDGFb when adhering to the avb3 ligand vitronectin than when they adhere to the b1 integrin ligand collagen ( 26 ) .
In addition to activating FAK , some b1 and av integrins also activate the tyrosine kinase Fyn and , through it , the adapter protein Shc ( 4 ) .
Rac promotes cell cycle progression , an effect that correlates with its ability to organize the cytoskeleton and promote spreading , rather than with its ability to activate MAP kinases ( 63 ) .
Yes and Lck are known to be enriched in rafts and may mediate the activation of Shc when Fyn is not expressed .
Integrin signaling may be needed for the transcription of cyclin D1 , because the cyclin D1 promoter is coordinately regulated by JNK and ERK ( 37 ) ( Fig. 4 ) .
Activated JNK enters the nucleus and phosphorylates the transcription factor c-Jun , which combines with c-Fos to form the AP-1 transcription factor complex .
Several integrins have been found to associate laterally with the oligomeric membrane protein caveolin-1 , at least in primary cells ( 4 , 5 ) . Although the biochemical nature of this interaction is not known , inhibiting caveolin expression suppresses the formation of focal adhesions and integrin signaling ( 4 , 5 ) .
IAP , an immunoglobulin superfamily transmembrane protein , cooperates with b3 integrins in binding thrombospondin to cells , and it also activates an inhibitory trimeric guanine nucleotide @- binding protein ( 29 ) .
The FAK and Shc pathways are regulated both positively and negatively by tyrosine phosphatases . Integrin @-@ mediated activation of ERK is suppressed in cells that lack the re @- ceptor @-@ type protein tyrosine phosphatase a or the cytosolic phosphatase SHP-2 ( 19 ) . These enzymes dephosphorylate the negative regulatory site in Src @-@ family kinases and thus , presumably , amplify both FAK and Shc signaling .
Two cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatases , PTP @-@ PEST and PTP-1B , target p130CAS and may specifically inhibit some of the signals downstream of FAK ( 20 ) .
Stat3 is activated by phosphorylation on Tyr-705 , which leads to dimer formation , nuclear translocation , and regulation of gene expression .
Here , we report that Stat3 was specifically associated with PKC delta in vivo in an IL-6 @-@ dependent manner in several cell types . Furthermore , Stat3 was phosphorylated by PKC delta in vivo on Ser-727 ,
Finally , we showed that the phosphorylation of Stat3 by PKC delta led to a negative regulation of Stat3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity .
Here , we report that Stat3 was specifically associated with PKC delta in vivo in an IL-6 @-@ dependent manner in several cell types .
interleukin-17 induces time @-@ dependent stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK 1 , 2 and 3 , Tyk 2 and STAT 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 within 0.5 to 30 min
In @-@ gel tryptic fragmentation and mass spectroscopy identified the major IL-6 @-@ dependent STAT3 @-@ co @-@ shifted p60 protein as the chaperone GRP58 @/@ ER-60 @/@ ERp57 .
Ariadne : GRP58 is a major target for tyrosine phosphorylation by the Lyn kinase ( 76 ) , a kinase that can be activated by IL-6 through gp130 signaling
Moreover , in human lymphoid cell lines of B @- and T-cell origin ( Raji , Jurkat , and NC-37 ) , IL-6 stimulated production of MMP-9 and MMP-2 but not TIMP-1 . In the Matrigel invasion assay IL-6 significantly upregulated transmigration of Raji and Jurkat cells , which in turn was inhibited by recombinant human TIMP-1 and anti @-@ MMP-9 and MMP-2 antibodies .
Furthermore , the anti @-@ CD38 agonist antibody expectedly inhibited bone resorption in the pit assay and elevated interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) secretion . IL-6 , in turn , enhanced CD38 mRNA expression
Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates MEK-1 , a kinase that activates the extracellular signal regulated kinases ( ERK )
Human SAA2 promoter Early experiments in which a human SAA2 genomic clone was transiently transfected into mouse L cells established that A-SAA expression is enhanced by IL-1 beta , TNF-alpha , IL-6 and IFN-gamma [ 146 , 147 ] .
Mincle mRNA expression was strongly induced in response to several inflammatory stimuli , such as LPS , TNF-alpha , IL-6 , and IFN-gamma in wild-type macrophages .
The mouse Mincle proximal promoter region contains an indispensable NF-IL6 binding element , demonstrating that Mincle is a direct target of NF-IL6 .
Transcriptional interference between PPARalpha and both c-Jun and p65 occurs reciprocally , since c-Jun and p65 also inhibit PPARalpha @-@ mediated activation of a PPAR response element @-@ driven promoter .
LPS stimulation resulted in a significant increase of IL-6 production ( approximately 3 @-@ fold ) in wild-type mice aortas , in agreement with previous observations ( 26 ) . However , this increase was much greater in aortas isolated from the PPARa 2 @/@ 2 mice ( 12 @-@ fold , p , 0.03 ) .
Cotransfection of c-Jun and c-Fos also strongly activated the wild-type human IL-6 promoter ( Fig. 3B ) .
Cotransfection of c-Jun and c-Fos also strongly activated the wild-type human IL-6 promoter ( Fig. 3 B ) .
Cotransfection of the p65 NF-kB subunit resulted in a strong activation of wild-type IL-6 promoter activity ( 11 @-@ fold ) ( Fig. 3A ) .
Devchand et al. ( 11 ) showed that absence of PPARa expression in mice prolonged the inflammatory response .
Furthermore , activation of PPARalpha represses both c-Jun @- and p65 @-@ induced transcription of the human IL-6 promoter .
Here , we show that aortic explants isolated from PPARalpha @-@ null mice display an exacerbated response to inflammatory stimuli , such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , as demonstrated by increased IL-6 secretion .
IL-6 controls macrophage and T cell activation , SMC proliferation , and migration and is a major regulator of the acute phase response ( 5 ) .
Here we show that RIP2 activates the extracellular signal @-@ regulated kinase ( ERK ) pathway and that the kinase activity of RIP2 appears to be important in this process .
RIP2 activates AP-1 and serum response element regulated expression by inducing the activation of the Elk1 transcription factor .
RIP2 is a serine @-@ threonine kinase associated with the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor complex and is implicated in the activation of NF-kappaB and cell death in mammalian cells .
Kinase @-@ defective point and deletion variants of RIP2 also significantly blocked the activation of ERK2 by TNFalpha but not epidermal growth factor .
The haematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase ( HePTP ) is a negative regulator of the MAP kinases Erk1 , Erk2 and p38 .
Endothelial cells treated with heme ( 10 microM ) and IL-6 ( 25 ng @/@ ml ) , increased HO-1 mRNA 15 @- and 60 @-@ fold , respectively .
We have shown that the inflammatory cytokines , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and heme @-@ induced HO-1 gene expression , were suppressed by dexamethasone ( Dex ) in a sustained manner .
STAT3 @-@ specific probe inhibited nuclear binding protein to the putative HO-1 @-@ STAT3 sequence . This suggests that IL-6 induction of human HO-1 is mediated via the JAK @-@ STAT pathway and that Dex inhibition of gene expression is carried out by activation of a transcriptional protein in competition with the STAT3 binding site .
In PBMC , LPS significantly induced G-CSF and interleukin ( IL ) - 1 , an inducer of G-CSF . Both were partly inhibited by IL-4 , IL-6 and IL-10 .
Supernatants of monocytes stimulated with the F ( ab ' ) 2 preparation of anti @-@ U1 @-@ RNP antibodies enhanced the amounts of both Il-1 alpha and IL-6 associated with HPAECs almost as effectively as those stimulated with intact autoantibody molecules .
Rac3V12 expression significantly increased the incorporation of BrdUrd into nascent DNA ( Fig. 3 ) , emphasizing that transfection of active Rac3 drives epithelial cell proliferation .
Expression of either dominant @-@ negative Rac3N17 or PBD F107 almost completely blocked Pak and JNK activities , demonstrating that Rac3 is upstream of these proteins ( Fig. 4B ) .
Pak activity was increased 4 @- to 6 @-@ fold in the three cell lines containing active Rac3 ( Fig. 4A ) . This increased kinase activity was mainly associated with the Pak2 isoform , which can phosphorylate and positively regulate Raf-1 activity , another key component in cell proliferation ( 38 @-@ 40 )
The activation of STAT3 by the cytokine receptor gp130 is required for both the G1 to S cell cycle transition and antiapoptosis . # [ JL ] IL6ST is gp130
In this paper we demonstrate that expression of CD72 down-modulates both extracellular signal @-@ related kinase ( ERK ) activation and Ca2+ mobilization induced by BCR ligation in the mouse B lymphoma line K46^mA , whereas BCR @-@ mediated ERK activation was not reduced by the ITIM @-@ mutated form of CD72 .
Results CD72 negatively regulates both ERK activation and Ca2+ mobilization induced by BCR ligation in the K46^mk B lymphoma cells To investigate the signaling function of CD72 , we assessed CD72 expression on the surface of B cell lines by flow cytometry .
However , both of the CD72 transfectants showed reduced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 compared to that of the parent cells regardless of the duration of Ag stimulation .
Taken together , expression of CD72 most probably down @-@ modu @-@ lates phosphorylation of ERK induced by BCR signaling .
Indeed , in vitro kinase assay showed that the activity of ERK2 in Ag @-@ stimulated K46^mA CD72 transfectants was lower than that of Ag @-@ stimulated K46^mA ( Fig. 3 ) .
However , the CD72 transfectants showed less increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration than the parent K46^mA cells did .
Thus , expression of CD72 appears to negatively regulate BCR @-@ mediated Ca2+ mobilization in K46^mA cells .
Taken together , CD72 down-modulates both ERK activation and Ca2+ mobilization induced by BCR ligation , strongly suggesting that CD72 negatively regulates BCR signaling in K46^mA cells .
Western blotting of total cell lysates using anti @-@ phospho @-@ ERK Ab showed that both ERK1 and ERK2 were phosphorylated by either BCR ligation alone or coligation of BCR and CD72 ( Fig. 6B ) .
However , BCR ligation induced stronger ERK phosphorylation than coligation of CD72 with BCR did , indicating that BCR ligation @-@ induced phosphorylation of ERK is down-modulated when CD72 is coligated with BCR .
Phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 induced by coligation of BCR and CD72 was weaker than that induced by BCR ligation alone ( Fig. 6 C ) , indicating that coligation with CD72 reduced BCR ligation @-@ mediated phosphorylation of ERK in DBA @/@ 2 spleen cells .
Coligation of CD72 with BCR showed a reduced Ca2+ flux compared to that with BCR ligation alone in spleen B cells ( Fig. 6D ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that coligation with CD72 negatively regulates BCR @-@ induced ERK activation and Ca2+ concentration in normal spleen B cells .
Furthermore , the hCdc14 phosphatases were found to dephosphorylate p53 specifically at the p34 ( Cdc2 ) / clb phosphorylation site ( p53 @-@ phosphor @-@ Ser ( 315 ) ) .
Overexpression of mutant FGFR3 resulted in IL-6 independence , decreased apoptosis , and an enhanced proliferative response to IL-6 .
B9 clones expressing either wild-type FGFR3 at high levels or mutant FGFR3 displayed increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and higher levels of bcl-x ( L ) expression than did parental B9 cells after cytokine withdrawal .
Treatment of cells expressing SRC-1 with epidermal growth factor enhanced the ligand @-@ dependent , progesterone receptor @-@ mediated activation of a target reporter gene . These results identify phosphorylation as a regulatory modification of SRC-1 and provide a basis upon which to identify signaling pathways that regulate SRC-1 function and , consequently , modify steroid @/@ nuclear receptor action .
Furthermore , Erk-2 phosphorylated threonine 1179 and serine 1185 ( and to a lesser extent , serine 395 ) in vitro , suggesting the importance of this pathway for SRC-1 regulation .
overexpressions of cyclin D1 or bcl-2 inhibited only differentiation or apoptosis , respectively
Although STAT3 is essential for IL-6 @-@ induced macrophage differentiation of M1 cells , GATA-1 had little or no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation , DNA binding , and transcriptional activities of STAT3 in Western blot analysis , electropholic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) , and luciferase assays .
During IL-6 @-@ induced macrophage differentiation of M1 cells , IL-6 down-regulated cyclin D1 expression and induced p19 ( INK4D ) expression , leading to reduction in cdk4 activities . In contrast , sustained expression of cyclin D1 and a significantly lesser amount of p19 ( INK4D ) induction were observed in IL-6 @-@ treated M1 cells overexpressing GATA-1 .
High concentrations of stauro of up to 1 microM only partially inhibit IL-3 @-@ stimulated Bcl2 phosphorylation but completely block PKC @-@ mediated Bcl2 phosphorylation in vitro
p44MAPK @/@ extracellular signal @-@ regulated kinase 1 ( ERK1 ) and p42 MAPK @/@ ERK2 are activated by IL-3 , colocalize with mitochondrial Bcl2 , and can directly phosphorylate Bcl2 on Ser-70 in a stauro @-@ resistant manner both in vitro and in vivo
We found that TPO stimulation or Ha-Ras G12V expression led to up-regulation of cyclin D1 , cyclin D2 , and cyclin D3 expression .
By using a refined model of megakaryocytic differentiation , we found that either TPO stimulation or Ha-Ras G12V expression could up-regulate the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 in addition to cyclin D3 , and that , when cdc2 activity was suppressed , each of cyclin D1 , cyclin D2 , and cyclin D3 expression was able to induce megakaryocytic differentiation with a similar efficiency .
which are dual @-@ specificity ( serine @/@ threonine and tyrosine ) kinases that regulate downstream responses to a broad range of mitogenic , apoptotic , and differentiation @-@ inducing stimuli [ 368 @-@ 372 ] . Interestingly , MEK1 but not MEK2 is stimulated by H2O2 treatment , suggesting that only MEK1 is redox @-@ sensitive [ 154 ] .
Additionally , several studies have shown that antioxidant enzymes and mimics also block NF-kB activation by various stimuli . For example , overexpression of peroxiredoxin [ 247 ] or thioredoxin [ 111 ] blocks NF-kB activation by H2O2 .
Furthermore , in many types of cells , antioxidants diminish or completely eliminate NF-kB activation ( Table 1 ) . For example , H2O2 , UV , and ionizing radiation have all been observed to stimulate degradation of IkB ( Table 1 ) . Conversely , antioxidants and reductants such as BHA , NGA , a-tocopherol , NAC , and PDTC decrease NF-kB activity and translocation [ 12,253 ] .
Once activated , Raf-1 phosphorylates serines in the catalytic sites of MKK @/@ MEK [ 345,367 ] . MKK1 @/@ MEK1 and MKK2 @/@ MEK2 activate members of the MAP kinase family ( ERK-1 @/@ ERK-2 ) ,

We have further identified , in the GFAP promoter region , a STAT3 site at which nucleotide substitutions almost completely abolished the IL-11 @-@ induced GFAP promoter activation .
Activation of the GFAP gene promoter by IL-11 and related cytokines Previous studies have shown that stimulation of gp130 molecules on neuroepithelial cells by LIF , CNTF , or the IL-6 @/@ sIL-6R complex induces activation of the GFAP gene promoter ( Bonni et al. , 1997 ; Nakashima et al. , 1999 b ) .
As shown in Fig. 5B , immediately after -@ irradiation , the amount of threonine 68 @- phosphorylated Chk2 increased ( lane 2 ) , and prior treatment of cells with caffeine markedly reduced this increase ( lane 4 ) .
As shown in Fig. 3A in normal cells , IR causes activation of Chk2 @/@ Cds1 ( lane 2 ) , and this activation is inhibited by prior treatment of cells with caffeine ( lane 4 ) .
Immediately after IR , an increase in serine 216 @-@ phosphorylated Cdc25C was observed in the nuclear fraction ( Fig. 1B , lane 2 ) , and prior treatment of cells with caffeine inhibited this increase ( Fig. 1B , lane 4 ) .
As shown in Fig. 6A , ATM immunoprecipitated from irradiated cells was more active than that from unirradiated cells , and both the basal and radiationinduced ATM activities were inhibited by caffeine with an IC50 at around 200 M.
However , no such activation was found in A-T cells indicating that caffeine inhibited the ATM @-@ dependent Chk2 @/@ Cds1 activation ( Fig. 3A , lanes 6 and 8 ) .
Substitution of threonine 68 by alanine in the full @-@ length kinase @-@ dead Chk2 dramatically reduced but did not abolish the ATM phosphorylation of Chk2 @/@ Cds1 in vitro ( Fig. 4B ; threonine 68 accounts for approximately 70 % of the total phosphorylation ) .
Serine 15 in the N terminus of p53 has been shown to be the preferred ATM phosphorylation site ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) . As shown in Fig. 7A , ATM immunoprecipitated from irradiated cells was more active than that from control cells , and both ATM activities were inhibited by caffeine with IC50 at around 200 M.
Both Chk1 and Chk2 @/@ Cds1 have been shown to localize to the nucleus and to phosphorylate serine 216 of Cdc25C in vitro ( 13 , 15 ) ( 18 @–@ 21 ) .
As shown in the Western blot ( Fig. 1A , lane 3 ) , the phospho @-@ S216 antibody recognized Cdc25C that was incubated with a wild type Chk2 in the in vitro kinase assay but failed to recognize unphosphorylated Cdc25C , incubated with a kinase @-@ dead mutant ( D347A ) ( Fig. 1A , lane 2 ) .
We found that STAT3 , but not STAT5 , was activated in response to IGF-I in 293T cells cotransfected with IGF @-@ IR and STAT expression vectors . Moreover , tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 , JAK1 , and JAK2 was increased upon IGF-I stimulation of endogenous IGF @-@ IR in 293T cells transfected with the respective STAT or JAK expression vector .

Inhibition of SHP2 activation leads to increased SOCS3 @-@ mRNA levels , whereas increased expression of SOCS3 results in a reduction of SHP2 phosphorylation after activation of the interleukin-6 signal transduction pathway .
In situ end @-@ labeling detection showed that apoptotic cell death was significantly increased in cells with 5 @-@ day treatment of antisense H-ras oligodeoxynucleotide ( 34.0 +/- 4.5 % ) in comparing with cells without treatment ( 2.5 +/- 1.2 % , t = 13.434 , P < 0.01 ) or treated with non @-@ specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide ( 4.8 +/- 1.4 % , t = 12.453 , P < 0.01 ) at the corresponding time .
\" Negative regulation of growth hormone receptor @/@ JAK2 signaling by signal regulatory protein alpha . \"
FGFs activate the endogenous FGFRs leading to the formation of a Grb2 @/@ FRS2 @/@ Shp2 complex and activation of MAP kinase .
However , immature osteoblasts respond to FGF treatment with increased proliferation , whereas in differentiating cells FGF does not induce DNA synthesis but causes apoptosis .
When either primary or OB1 osteoblasts are induced to differentiate , FGF signaling inhibits expression of alkaline phosphatase , and blocks mineralization .

GEF activity of Ras @-@ GRF1 toward Ha-Ras , as defined by in vitro GDP binding and release assays , was augmented after tyrosine phosphorylation by ACK1 .
Ras @-@ GRF1 acts as a GEF for Rac when tyrosine @-@ phosphorylated following G protein @-@ coupled receptor stimulation .
We show here that activated ACK1 , a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the focal adhesion kinase family , causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras @-@ GRF1 .
Stimulation by IL-18 strongly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and of the mitogen @-@ activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) p44 erk-1 and p42 erk-2 .
MAPK activation appears to play a prominent role in IL-18 signaling , being involved in transcription and translation of IL-18 @-@ induced IFN-gamma mRNA and IL-18 @-@ induced cytolytic effects .
Moreover , cord blood T cells cultured with IGF-1 and PHA had a higher resistance to anti @-@ Fas @-@ induced apoptosis as compared with PHA @-@ activated cord blood T cells . IGF-1 also significantly inhibited PHA @-@ induced Fas expression on cord blood T cells
Our previous study indicated that IGF-1 could significantly increase IL-6 mRNA expression and protein production in PHA @- activated cord blood MNC ( 12 ) .
constitutively active kinases within the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 pathway ( MEKK1 , MEK1 ) or the p38 pathway ( ASK1 , MEKK1 , MKK3 ) are potent activators of the MMP-1 promoter
TGF-b1 also stimulates H2O2 production in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells ( 22 ) , vascular endothelial cells ( 23 ) , mouse osteoblastic cells ( 24 ) , and human lung fibroblast ( HLF ) cells ( 25 , 26 ) .
TGF-b1 ( 1 ng @/@ ml ) - induced intracellular ROS levels in HLF cells were measured with DCFH @-@ DA and laser @-@ scanning confocal microscopy ... As shown in Fig. 1 , A and B , DCF fluorescence displayed a rapid increase with maximal intensity at 5 min after treatment and was followed by a decline in fluorescence to the basal level by 20 min .
Also , stimulation with TGF-b1 ( 1 ng @/@ ml ) caused a time @-@ dependent increase in IL-6 protein accumulation in the culture supernatants ( Fig. 2C ) .
The amount of 1 ng @/@ ml TGF-b1 was sufficient to induce the IL-6 mRNA ( Fig. 2A ) . TGF-b1 ( 1 ng @/@ ml ) treatment produced a progressive increase in IL-6 mRNA concentrations , beginning as early as 30 min , peaking at 12 h , and decreasing after 24 h ( Fig. 2B ) .

Using immunocytochemistry , Bradding et al. [ 1 ± 4 ] reported that interleukin ( IL ) - 4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , and tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a were present within mast cells in nasal and bronchial mucosa taken from both normal subjects and patients with allergic perennial rhinitis ,
STAM2 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases since coexpression of STAM2 with Jak1 or Jak2 but not an unrelated Tec family kinase , Etk , resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAM2 is induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet @-@ derived growth factor as well as by cytokines like IL-3 .
Finally , overexpression of wild type STAM2 led to an increase in IL-2 @-@ mediated induction of c-Myc promoter activation indicating that it potentiates cytokine receptor signaling .
Additionally , T cells from CCR2 ( -/ ) - immunized mice showed decreased antigen @-@ induced proliferation and production of IFN-gamma compared with wild-type immunized controls , suggesting that CCR2 enhances the T helper cell type 1 immune response in EAE .
At days 8 , 11 , 20 , 23 , and 26 after disease induction , splenocytes from CCR2 @-@ deficient mice also proliferated less robustly to Ag and secreted lower levels of IFN- { gamma } and IL-6 than splenocytes from wild-type controls
The wild-type Ki-ras transfectants lack functional TGF-beta receptors , whereas all three Ki-ras ( G12V ) transfectants expressed functional TGF-beta receptors that bound ( 125 ) I-TGF-beta1 .
GnT-V transcription was stimulated by several oncogenes including src , her -@ 2 @/@ neu , H @- ras , and v @- sis ( 9 , 10 , 11 ) , and this overexpression was regulated through the ras @-@ raf @-@ ets pathways .
Each of three Ki-ras ( G12V ) transfectants responded to TGF-beta1 by an increase in proliferation and by decreasing the abundance of the Cdk inhibitor p21 and the tumor suppressor PTEN , whereas each of three wild-type Ki-ras transfectants remained unresponsive to TGF-beta1 .
SIRP is a transmembrane protein that is now known to bind to integrin @-@ associated protein . It appears to bind directly to JAK2 by a process that does not require tyrosyl phosphorylation , although is itself highly phosphorylated on tyrosines in response to GH . The phosphorylated SIRP recruits one or more molecules of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 that , in turn , de-phosphorylates SIRP and most likely JAK2 .
Consistent with acting through a G protein @-@ coupled receptor , estradiol signaling to Erk-1 @/@ Erk-2 occurred via a Gbetagamma @-@ dependent , pertussis toxin @-@ sensitive pathway that required Src @-@ related tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine 317 of the Shc adapter protein .
Reinforcing this idea , estradiol signaling to Erk-1 @/@ Erk-2 was dependent upon trans @-@ activation of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor via release of heparan @-@ bound EGF ( HB @-@ EGF ) .
Estrogen rapidly activates the mitogen @-@ activated protein kinases , Erk-1 and Erk-2 , via an as yet unknown mechanism . requires the expression of the G protein @-@ coupled receptor homolog , GPR30 .

Correspondingly , in vitro kinase assays showed that N17Rac1 inhibited the kinase activities of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 stimulated by target signals ( Fig. 4b ) .
Introduction of N17Rac1 into NK92 cells totally blocked PAK1 activation triggered by target ligation , whereas introduction of V12Rac1 strongly stimulated PAK1 activity even in the absence of target cells ( Fig. 7d ) .
Examination of whole cell lysates from the same NK92 cells showed that kinase @-@ deficient ( KD ) PAK1 , unlike control CD56 , also effectively suppressed MEK and ERK activation by target ligation ( Fig. 7b ) . Thus , PAK1 is upstream of both MEK and ERK in the NK lytic process .

These results suggest that ERK2 has a regulatory role in activating CREB in vivo in lung neutrophils after hemorrhage or endotoxemia .
Tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 was detected at a very low concentration of IL-4 ( 1 ng @/@ ml ) , while IL-13 induced phosphorylation only at concentrations of 50 ng @/@ ml and above , both in normal ( Figure 2a , b , upper blots ) and tumor lung myo®broblasts ( Figure 2c , d , upper blots ) .
the constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed repeatedly in tumor myo®bro @- blasts ( Figure 6f ) , but only occasionally in normal ®broblasts ( Figure 6e ) . In the latter cells , IL-4 and IL @- 13 induced ( Figure 6d ) or increased ( Figure 6e ) the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 , whereas in tumor myo®broblasts the two cytokines only caused an increase in the phosphorylation of STAT3 ( Figure 6f ) .
In normal lung ®broblasts and in tumor myo®broblasts , STAT6 was indeed phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to IL-4 and IL-13 ( Figure 4a , b , upper blots ) .
Finally , Tyk2 , the fourth member of the JAK family , was found to be constitutively tyrosine @-@ phosphorylated in these cells . However , IL-4 and IL-13 increased its phosphorylation level in lung myo®broblasts ( Figure 2j ) , but not in normal cells , where both cytokines appear to slightly decrease its extent of phosphoryla @- tion ( Figure 2i ) .
IL-4 and IL-13 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 ( green cytoplasmic staining ) but probably also nuclear translocation of some phosphorylated STAT6 mole @- cules , accounting for the yellow signal detected . Similar results were obtained with normal lung ®broblasts .
Using purified wild-type and mutant c-Raf-1 proteins , we demonstrate that Thr ( 269 ) is the major c-Raf-1 site phosphorylated by KSR in vitro and that phosphorylation of this site is essential for c-Raf-1 activation by KSR .
In vivo , low physiologic doses of EGF ( 0.001 @-@ 0.1 ng @/@ ml ) stimulated KSR activation and induced Thr ( 269 ) phosphorylation and activation of c-Raf-1 .
In conclusion , our results show that IL-6 stimulates hepatic IGFBP-4 gene expression and production in vitro and in vivo , thereby suggesting another mechanism by which cytokines could control IGF-I action .

Enhancement of CXC chemokine receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) mRNA expression was observed upon treatment with the cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta .
Stimulation of cells with the ligand for CXCR4 , stromal cell @-@ derived factor-1 alpha ( SDF-1 alpha ) , resulted in an elevation in intracellular Ca ( 2+ ) concentration
resulted in an elevation in intracellular Ca ( 2+ ) concentration and activation of the mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase cascade , specifically , extracellular signal @-@ regulated kinase 2 ( ERK2 ) mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase .
IL-1 beta stimulation also enhanced CXCR4 expression ( 28.8 % for CRT-J and 41.6 % for U87 @-@ MG cells ) .
SDF-1 alpha @-@ induced chemokine expression was abrogated upon inclusion of U0126 , a pharmacological inhibitor of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , indicating that the ERK signaling cascade is involved in this response .
In T47D cells , IL-6 stimulated the activation of Janus @-@ activated kinase 1 tyrosine kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) 1 and STAT3 transcription factors .

insulin receptor phosphorylates a number of intracellular substrates on tyrosine including members of the insulin receptor substrate family ( IRS1 @/@ IRS2 @/@ IRS3 @/@ IRS4 ) , the Shc adaptor ...
Insulin stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of its receptor , leading to the phosphorylation of a number of cellular substrates , including Gab1 , Shc , IRS 1 - 4 , and Cbl . Gab1 appears to interact with the SH2 containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 , leading to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway .
Overexpression of these enzymes [ LAR and PTP1B ] in cultured cells prevents insulin receptor kinase activation .
The translocation of phosphorylated cbl recruits additional signaling proteins to the lipid raft , resulting in the activation of the G protein TC10 .

SB203580 , a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor , attenuated these effects , further confirming that both MMK6 and MMK3 act via p38 MAPK , whereas they had no effect on the increase in glucose transport induced by a constitutively active MAPK kinase 1 ( MEK1 ) mutant or by myristoylated Akt .
Constitutively active MKK6 @/@ MKK3 mutants up-regulated GLUT1 expression and down-regulated GLUT4 expression , thereby significantly increasing basal glucose transport but diminishing transport induced by insulin .
A similar 24P3 induction was observed in other T cell lymphomas ( EL4 and TH201 ) in response to IL-9 , as well as in EL4 cells stimulated with IL-6 or IL-1 .

Immunoblot analysis of extracts from control and HT15 cells showed an increase in the activated forms of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in the Sod2 @-@ overexpressing cells that was reversed upon coexpression of catalase ( Fig. 5A ) .
Analysis of IL-1a levels in Sod2 @-@ overexpressing cells showed a 3 @-@ fold increase in basal IL-1a levels that was reversed when catalase was coexpressed in these cell lines ( Fig. 2A ) .
Thus , a 15 @-@ fold increase in Sod2 levels , which is well within the range of activity observed in response to cytokines and growth factors , can enhance MMP-1 expression in an H2O2 @-@ dependent fashion .
In support of this hypothesis , the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and the mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-7 were increased in the Sod2 overexpressors compared with control cell lines ( Fig. 5C , left panel ) .
The observed decline in MMP-9 activity in the HT15 cell line may represent a negative regulatory aspect of Sod2 in MMP expression .
The induction of MMP-13 by IL-1a and phorbol myristate acetate was severely impaired in the Sod2 -/+ fibroblasts compared with the Sod2 +/+ fibroblasts ( Fig. 3 , A and B ) .
the wild-type MEFs responded to the induction of MMP-13 by TNF , whereas the heterozygotes did not .
Although the growth factors epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and neuregulin ( NRG ) 1 similarly stimulated Erk1 @/@ Erk2 in MDA @-@ MB-361 cells , EGF acting through an EGF receptor @/@ ErbB2 heterodimer preferentially stimulated protein kinase C , and NRG1 beta acting through an ErbB2 @/@ ErbB3 heterodimer preferentially stimulated Akt .
In MDA @-@ MB-453 cells , NRG1 beta acting through an ErbB2 @/@ ErbB3 heterodimer stimulated prolonged signaling of all pathways examined relative to NRG2 beta acting through the same heterodimeric receptor species . Surprisingly , NRG1 beta and NRG2 beta also regulated partially overlapping but distinct sets of genes in these cells .
As expected , EGF preferentially stimulated the recruitment of the adaptor protein Grb2 to EGF receptor whereas NRG1 beta preferentially stimulated the recruitment of this protein to ErbB3 . NRG1 beta also preferentially stimulated the association of p85 , the 85 @-@ kDa subunit of PI3K , with ErbB3 , as demonstrated previously ( 40 ) .
Although the growth factors epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and neuregulin ( NRG ) 1 similarly stimulated Erk1 @/@ Erk2 in MDA @-@ MB-361 cells , EGF acting through an EGF receptor @/@ ErbB2 heterodimer preferentially stimulated protein kinase C , and NRG1 beta acting through an ErbB2 @/@ ErbB3 heterodimer preferentially stimulated Akt .
We find that Cdk10 binds full length Ets2 in vitro and in vivo and inhibits Ets2 transactivation in mammalian cells .
Consistently , substrate @-@ trapping experiments with a SHP2 catalytic inactive mutant suggested that Gab1 was a SHP2 PTPase substrate in the cells . Therefore , Gab1 not only is a SHP2 activator but also is a target of its PTPase .
We found that both Tyr-627 and Tyr-659 of Gab1 were required for SHP2 binding to Gab1 and for ERK2 activation by EGF .
We demonstrated that lung myofibroblasts , incubated in the presence of E2 , showed a rapid phosphorylation on serine-259 of Raf1 and tyrosine-204 of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAP kinase at 15 min , by approximately 3 @- and 5 @-@ fold , respectively
since in PKR @-@ null MEFs there is a marked defect in Erk1 and Erk2 activation by PDGF ( Figure 1D ) , it appears that PKR is involved in serine phosphorylation of Stat3 through the activation of Erks .
Whereas PKR +/+ cells exhibited a clear induction in phospho @-@ Ser727 Stat3 , PKR @-@ null cells were defective in this process ( Figure 1B )
Accordingly , nuclear extracts prepared from PDGF @-@ treated PKR @- null cells were severely deficient in Stat3 containing DNA @-@ binding complexes compared with wild-type MEFs ( data not shown ) . Taken together , we conclude that PDGF @-@ induced activation of Stat3 DNA binding is PKR dependent .
PDGF treatment induced two Tyr705 @-@ phosphorylated forms of Stat3 in PKR +/+ cells , a faster migrating species termed Stat3 fm and a slower migrating species termed Stat3 sm ( Figure 1A ) ..... Importantly , PDGF treatment did not induce either form of tyrosine @-@ phosphorylated Stat3 in PKR @-@ null cells ( Figure 1A ) , implicating a requirement for PKR in both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat3 .
The results ( Figure 4A and B ) showed a 16 @-@ fold induction in PKR wild-type cells in contrast to a 0.8 @-@ fold induction in c-fos message in PKR @-@ null cells at 15 min of PDGF treatment
Immunoblotting with anti @-@ Stat3 as well as anti @-@ PKR anti bodies ( Figure 2E ) showed an increase in interaction within 5 @-@ 15 min of treatment with the growth factor , followed by a decrease to below basal level at later time points .

Serum amyloid A @-@ activating factor-1 ( SAF-1 ) is a zinc finger transcription factor that is activated by many mediators of inflammation including IL-1 , IL-6 , and bacterial LPS .

Inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts blocks MyoD expression , SHPS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation and the association of SHPS-1 with SHP-2 .
Either constitutive expression or inducible activation of MyoD in 10T ( 1 @/@ 2 ) fibroblasts promotes SHPS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation and its association with SHP-2 .
We have identified that the 120 kDa complex consists of the SHP-2 substrate-1 ( SHPS-1 ) and the Grb2 @-@ associated binder-1 ( Gab-1 ) . SHPS-1 , but not Gab-1 , undergoes tyrosyl phosphorylation and association with SHP-2 during myogenesis ,

Overexpression of both MEN2A @-@ RET and STAT3 strongly enhanced reporter activation , indicating that MEN2A @-@ RET induces cyclin @-@ D1 gene expression via STAT3 ( Figure 4a ) .
These data indicate that MEN2A @-@ RET enhances proliferation via STAT3 , and that a full length STAT3 is required to mediate the MEN2A @-@ RET induced proliferation .
Over-expression of MEN2A @-@ RET mutants reduced STAT3 ser727 phosphorylation to basal levels , suggesting that STAT3 tyr705 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for maximal MEN2A @-@ RET induced STAT3 ser727 phosphorylation ( Figure 3b ) .
STAT3 tyr705 phosphorylation was reduced when the MEN2A @-@ RET single mutants tyr752 phe or tyr928 phe were overexpressed , while no STAT3 tyr705 phosphorylation was observed in the presence of the MEN2A @-@ RET double mutant ( Figure 3b ) .
As depicted in Figure 3a , mutation of tyr928 ( RET ) reduced STAT3 transactivation approximately 1.5 @-@ fold , indicating that other STAT3 docking sites must be present in MEN2A @-@ RET as well .
As depicted in Figure 1a , b , over-expression of both MEN2A @-@ RET and STAT3 strongly enhanced IRE transactivation , while overexpression of STAT3 alone did not affect reporter activation .
After bFGF was added to pulmonary fibroblasts , the kinase activities of p44 @/@ p42 ERK1 @/@ ERK2 were determined by an in @-@ gel assay at various times after exposure ( Fig. 1 ) . The data demonstrate that the addition of bFGF results in activation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 within 5 min , with the highest activity at 30 min , followed by a lower level of activity that persists for 8 @-@ 12 h .
PPARalpha ( NR1C1 ) controls lipid oxidation and clearance in hepatocytes and PPARgamma ( NR1C3 ) promotes preadipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis .
Furthermore , it has been shown that activation of PPARg by the thiozolidinedione , rosiglitazaone , decreased scavenger receptor class A expresion .
Pparg , which is activated by 15 @-@ deoxy @-@ D12,14 @-@ prostaglandin J2 and the thiazolidione class of insulin @-@ sensitizing drugs , ... Among its known target genes are adipocyte factty-acid binidng protein and fatty acid synthase , which are efeeectors of lipid accumulaiton during adipogeesis .
Therefore the profound repression of CYP27 and apoE expressoin by activatoin or overexpression of PPARd might contribute to the lipid accumulation observed in these cells in culture
However , plaque formation is also appreciated to be an inflammoratory response and it has been shown that activators of Pparg inhibit the production of inflammoratory cytokines such as TNFa , Il6 and Il1b .
These studies started with the observation that Pparg up-regulates CD36 ( savenger receptor calss-B ) expression in macrophages .

Substitution of Arg-238 , equivalent to conserved Arg in the 14-3-3 binding motif , with Glu ( R238E ) decreased 14-3-3 theta binding to PDK1 ( Fig. 3 C , upper panel , lane 4 ) . In contrast , substitution of Val-243 with Pro ( V243P ) , a residue conserved in many 14-3-3 targets , such as Raf-1 and Bad ( Fig. 3 A ) , dramatically increased the amount of 14-3-3 theta bound to PDK1

NIH3T3 cells expressing either Raf :ER @-@ DD or Raf : ER @-@ YY synthesized RALT upon stimulation with Tamoxifen for 4 ± 8 h in serum @-@ deprived medium ( Figure 4b ) . The effect of tamoxifen was as strong as serum stimulation and was reverted by the administra @- tion of U0126 ( Figure 4b )
Ablation of RALT expression by MEK @- 1 inhibitors is caused by suppression of RALT transcription , as indicated by the Northern blot analysis presented in Figure 3 .
Upon stimulation with EGF ( 0.3 ng @/@ ml ) or bFGF ( 0.3 ng @/@ ml ) about 20 % of uninjected EGFR @/@ ErbB-2 cells entered S phase ( data not shown ) .

We conclude that endogenous RALT protein behaves as a bonafide feedback inhibitor of the ErbB-2 kinase .

SHP-2 is a dual @-@ specificity phosphatase involved in Stat1 dephosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine residues in nuclei
In SHP-2 -/- mouse fibroblast cells , Stat1 phosphorylation at both the tyrosine residue Tyr ( 701 ) and the serine residue Ser ( 727 ) by IFNgamma was enhanced and prolonged .
Consistently , purified GST @-@ SHP-2 dephosphorylated Stat1 at both tyrosine and serine residues when immunoprecipitated phospho @-@ Stat1 or a peptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr ( P ) ( 701 ) or Ser ( P ) ( 727 ) of Stat1 was used as the substrate .
Here we show that after stimulation by growth factors Spry1 and Spry2 translocate to the plasma membrane and become phosphorylated on a conserved tyrosine .
Next , they bind to the adaptor protein Grb2 and inhibit the recruitment of the Grb2 @-@ Sos complex either to the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) docking adaptor protein FRS2 or to Shp2 . Membrane translocation of Spry is necessary for its phosphorylation , which is essential for its inhibitor activity .
Using an antibody against Spry2 , we showed that endogenous Spry2 becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to EGF or FGF stimulation in C2C12 cells ( Fig. 4b , left ) and in COS7 cells ( Fig. 4b , right ) .
In addition , neither xSpry1Y53F nor mSpry2Y55F was tyrosine phosphorylated in cells stimulated with EGF ( data not shown ) .
When Myc @-@ tagged mSpry2 and haemagluttinin A ( HA ) - tagged Grb2 were expressed in cultured cells , both molecules translocated to the ruffling membrane region in response to stimulation with FGF or EGF and colocalized there ( Fig. 1c ) .
both xSpry1Y53F and mSpry2Y55F were unable to inhibit the binding of Grb2 to FRS2 or Shp2 in response to FGF stimulation ( Fig. 2a , b ) or the recruitment of Grb2 @–@ Sos complex to FRS2 ( Fig. 2c ) .
We investigated the ability of the Spry mutants to bind to Grb2 . Both xSpry1Y53F and mSpry2Y55F failed to bind to Grb2 in response to FGF stimulation ( Fig. 5c ) .
We also found that the tyrosine @- phosphorylated , endogenous Spry2 binds to endogenous Grb2 in a manner dependent on FGF stimulation ( Fig. 4c ) .

STAP-2 mRNA was strongly induced in the liver in response to lipopolysaccharide and in isolated hepatocytes in response to interleukin-6 .
These data suggest that STAP-2 is a new class of adaptor molecule that modulates STAT3 activity through its YXXQ motif .
Because STAP-2 expression is induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or IL-1 beta , STAP-2 may play a role in the regulation of inflammation .

Overexpression of mSef in NIH3T3 cells results in a decrease in FGF @-@ induced cell proliferation associated with a decrease in Tyr phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FRS2 . As a consequence , there is a reduction in the phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser ( 338 ) , MEK1 @/@ MEK2 at Ser ( 217 ) and Ser ( 221 ) , and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 at Thr ( 202 ) and Tyr ( 204 ) .
These data indicate that adenovirus @-@ mediated expression of mSef reduced FGF @-@ induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR without affecting the overall level of FGFR expression ( Fig. 4 A ) .
Adenovirus @-@ mediated expression of mSef but not GFP resulted in a reduction in the levels of activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , whereas overall levels of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 were unaffected ( Fig. 2 A ) .

Mutational inactivation of the MYCantagonist Mxi-1 in prostate carcinoma may be another mechanism of MYC activation [ 54 ] . Mxi-1 inactivation would presumably shift the equilibrium between Mxi-1 @/@ MAX and c-MYC @/@ MAX in prostate cells towards c @- MYC @/@ MAX hetero-dimers , and therefore lead to elevated expression of c-MYC @-@ target genes .

Here we demonstrate that Ser311 accounts for zetaPKC phosphorylation of RelA and that this site is phosphorylated in vivo in response to TNF-alpha .
Also , an inactivating mutation of that residue severely impairs RelA transcriptional activity , blocks its anti @-@ apoptotic function and abrogates the interaction of RelA with the co-activator CBP as well as its recruitment , and that of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) with the interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) promoter .

In neutrophils challenged with LPS , IkB-a underwent time @-@ dependent degradation ( Fig. 8C ) . However , in neutrophils incubated with both LPS and H2O2 , no degradation of IkB-a was apparent .
neutrophils stimulated with LPS demonstrated increased TNF-a secretion ( Fig. 6A ) . The response was significantly attenuated by concurrent incubation of neutrophils with H2O2 .
As was the case for p38 , ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was both rapidly and persistently activated in neutrophils exposed to H2O2 ( Fig. 2A ) .
Similar to the patterns seen with ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and p38 , JNK activation in neutrophils exposed to H2O2 was both rapid and persistent ( Fig. 2B ) .
whereas exposure of neutrophils to LPS or TNF-a resulted in increased levels of the transcriptionally active serine 133 @-@ phosphorylated form of CREB
Exposure of neutrophils to LPS resulted in persistence of p38 activation that was similar to that produced by H2O2 , but the increase in phosphorylated p38 was less rapid , rising above baseline values more than 5 min after LPS was added to the neutrophils .

In ERK-1 +/+ MEFs , hyperoxia stimulated phosphorylation of Nrf2 ( lane 4 ) , when compared with room air @-@ exposed controls ( lane 3 ) .
However , a high proportion of Nrf2 accumulated in the nucleus of both cell types following the exposure of cells to hyperoxia ( Fig. 1A , right panels ) .

Results obtained with H-RasV12 partial loss of function mutants H-RasV12S35 ( Raf signal only ) , H-RasV12C40 ( PI3-kinase signal only ) and H-RasV12G37 ( RalGEFs signal only ) suggest that the H-Ras induction of the mouse ST6Gal I gene ( Siat1 ) transcription is primarily routed through RalGEFs .
Transformation by human K-Ras or H-Ras ( S12 and V12 point mutations , respectively ) results in a 10 @-@ fold increase in ST6Gal I mRNA , but no alteration in the expression of related sialyltransferases .
Survivin disruption by DN T34A Survivin blocked CA-Ras @-@ induced IL-3 @-@ independent cell survival and proliferation ; however , it did not affect CA-Ras @-@ mediated enhancement of S-phase , indicating that the anti @-@ apoptotic activity of CA-Ras is Survivin dependent while its S-phase enhancing effect is not .

Crucial to this enhanced proliferation is spontaneous interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) production and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) activation in BCL-6 ( -/- ) macrophages .

KLF5 accelerates mitotic entry in H-Ras @-@ transformed cells by transcriptionally activating cyclin B1 and Cdc2 , which leads to an increase in cyclin B1 @/@ Cdc2 kinase activity
We report that phosphorylation @-@ induced turnover of endogenous N-myc protein in CGNPs increases during mitosis , due to increased priming phosphorylation of N-myc for GSK-3 beta . The priming phosphorylation requires the Cdk1 complex , whose cyclin subunits are indirect Sonic hedgehog targets
We conclude that TNFalpha and IGF-I may additively contribute to fibrosis during intestinal inflammation . TNFR2 is a primary mediator of fibrogenic actions of TNFalpha acting through ERK1 @/@ ERK2 to stimulate proliferation and through STAT3 to stimulate TIMP-1 and inhibit collagen degradation .
Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha has defined proinflammatory
TNFalpha , but not IGF-I , induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ( TIMP-1 ) expression and reduced matrix metalloproteinases-2 activity and collagen degradation . TNFalpha also activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
These responses to TNFalpha were absent in TNFR2 -/- and TNFR1 @/@ TNFR2 -/- myofibroblasts , whereas TNFR1 -/- cells showed similar responses to WT .
Additionally , genistein enhanced RA @-@ induced neuronal differentiation by increasing the activation of extracellular signal @-@ related kinase 1 @/@ 2 ( ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ) via phosphorylation at Thr183 and Tyr185 in 3 @-@ 7 days .
Ag stimulation of Lyn unique domain transfectants was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK-2 , which are required for leukotriene C4 ( LTC4 ) release , and production of LTC4 was increased 3 @- to 5 @-@ fold , compared with cells transfected with vector alone .
Our analyses using epiregulin @-@ deficient mice with mixed and inbred genetic backgrounds revealed that epiregulin deficiency results in the reduction of IL-6 production levels in both cell types upon peptidoglycan stimulation , and that the extent of this reduction is more evident under the BALB @/@ c background compared with the C57BL @/@ 6J background .
rmEP reduced IL-18 expression in WT @- and EP –/– -@ derived keratinocytes at 8 h after stimulation , and there was no obvious difference between WT and EP –/– ( Fig. 3D ) .
Here , we show that ras @-@ transformed cancer cells can also induce TSP-1 down-regulation in their adjacent nontransformed stromal fibroblasts , but not in endothelial cells , in a paracrine and distance @-@ dependent manner .
Indeed , MDF528 nontransformed dermal fibroblasts , like many other types of normal nonangiogenic cells ( 12 ) , express copious amounts of TSP-1 ( Fig. 1B , lane 1 ) , which becomes undetectable in their H-ras -@ expressing counterparts ( 528 ras1 cells ; Fig. 1B , lane 2 ; refs .
Down-regulation of thrombospondin-1 promoter activity in nontumorigenic dermal fibroblasts exposed to tumor cell @-@ derived soluble mediator ( s ) .
Interestingly , exposure of MDF @-@ EGFP @/@ TSP-1 fibroblasts to conditioned medium derived rom H-ras @-@ expressing 528 ras1 cancer cells ( 528 ras1 conditioned medium ) induced a near complete inhibition of GFP fluorescence as indicated by both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry ( Fig. 2C , left ) .
Again , this effect was paralleled by comparable decreases in TSP-1 mRNA and protein expression in these cells exposed to 528 ras1 conditioned medium ( Fig. 2C ) .
In addition to the aforementioned paracrine properties of 528 ras1 cells , we observed that also conditioned medium of human colorectal cancer cells harboring a mutant K-ras oncogene ( DLD-1 ) , but not that of a DLD-1 variant with genetically disrupted K-ras allele ( DKO-3 cells ) , efficiently suppressed the activity of the TSP-1 reporter gene in MDF @-@ EGFP @/@ TSP-1 cells ( Fig. 4A ) .
Once again , we observed that expression of TSP-1 by the nontransformed MDFB6 fibroblasts was precipitously down-regulated when these cells were incubated with B6 ras conditioned medium ( Fig. 5A ) .
A , immortalized dermal fibroblasts ( MDFB6 ) down-regulate TSP-1 protein expression in the presence of conditioned medium from their H-ras @-@ transformed counterparts ( B6 ras CM ) ; quantification of representative Western blot .
B , absence of TSP-1 down-regulation in Id1 @-@ deficient dermal fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium of ras @-@ transformed ( 528 ras1 CM and B6 ras CM ) and neu @-@ transformed ( 528 neu CM ) tumor cells .
Paracrine effects of various ras @-@ driven cancer cells were detected at the level of TSP-1 protein , mRNA , and promoter activity ( Fig. 2C ) .
In contrast , abrogation of TSP-1 suppression was observed ( Fig. 6C ) when MDF528 cells were incubated with dimethylsphingosine , a specific inhibitor of sphingosine kinase .
Thus , suppression of TSP-1 promoter activity by fraction 2 of 528 ras1 conditioned medium was moderately sensitive to pertussis toxin but was completely abolished by dimethylsphingosine .
Table 3 . Alteration of Gene Expression Specially Associated with p53 and H-ras Status in Skin Tumorigenesis upregulated
It is known that there are two isoforms of ERK , ERK1 and ERK2 , and they phosphorylate and activate various transcription factors , such as Elk-1 and Elk-2 . These transcription factors regulate expression of diverse genes that relates to the proliferation and growth of the cells .
IL-12 activates the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK2 and Tyk2 , which in turn phosphorylate STAT4 on tyrosine 693 .
Among the cytokines expressed after 4 h of Ag stimulation in BMMCs , our data show that levels of mRNA and protein for IL-4 , IL-6 , and for IL-13 are all significantly higher in Lyn -/- than in WT BMMCs .
Our data show that mRNA coding for at least one transcription factor , the cytoplasmic NF-AT ( NF-ATC , also known as NFATC1 and NFAT2 ) is induced 3 @-@ fold more in Lyn –/– BMMCs than in WT BMMCs ( Table II ) .
The 33 @-@ fold up-regulation of sphingosine kinase 1 in Ag @-@ stimulated Lyn –/– BMMCs may also contribute to increased chemokine production
After 24 hours of IL-13 induction , phosphorylation of ERK1 ( p44 ) and ERK2 ( p42 ) but not JNK1 @/@ JNK2 or p38 MAPK was observed ( Figure 1 ) .
Our previous studies demonstrated that IL-13 causes MMP @- and cathepsin @-@ dependent lung remodeling and inhibits the expression of a1 @–@ AT ( 4 ) .
IL-13 Tg can be inducibly expressed in the adult murine lung by the administration of doxycycline @-@ containing ( dox @-@ containing ) water . As expected , increased levels of phospho @-@ STAT6 were readily detected by Western blot analysis after Tg activation ( Figure 1 ) .

BMMCs from mice lacking Map3k2 showed reduced production ( 50 @-@ 60 % ) of IL-6 , IL-13 , and TNF-alpha after stimulation
In asbestos @-@ associated transformation of rodent mesothelial cells , the use of dominant negative ERK1 or Fra-1 constructs reverses the phenotype of mesothelioma cells to that of normal mesothelial cells ( 12 ) . Moreover , Fra-1 expression is increased in human mesotheliomas and in other tumor types .
We have used siRNA approaches to show that Fra-1 expression is critical to the expression of genes , such as cd44 and c-met , that are critical to migration and autocrine growth factor production in transformation and invasion of mesotheliomas ( 13 ) .
In contrast , EGFR activation by gram @-@ positive bacteria occurred through cleavage of the transmembrane ligand HBEGF by ADAM 10 .
from full text - Furthermore , the decreased expression of either b-arrestin 1 or b-arrestin 2 ( via siRNA ) resulted in a decrease in ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activity
FBLN-3 expression in MB114 cells also prevented their activation of p38 MAPK , but not that of extracellular signal @-@ regulated kinase 1 @/@ 2 ( ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ) , stimulated by VEGF ( Fig. 2E ) .
Figure 3A shows that relative to control cells , FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 both decreased MB114 cell expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 while simultaneously increasing that of the MMP antagonists , TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 .
Although MB114 cell expression of TIMP-2 was unaffected by either FBLN-3 or FBLN-5 , both FBLNs induced MB114 cell expression of the angiostatic molecule , TSP-1 ( Fig. 3A ) .
Interestingly , although TIMP-3 expression was elevated basally in FBLN-5 @-@ expressing MB114 cells , only FBLN-3 stimulated TIMP-3 expression in tubulating MB114 cells ( Fig. 3B ) .
Gelatin zymography of MB114 cell conditioned medium confirmed that expression of either FBLN-3 or FBLN-5 significantly reduced MMP-2 protease activity in tubulating MB114 cells ( Fig. 3C ) .
FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 antagonize angiogenesis in vivo .
Moreover , recombinant FBLN-3 and FBLN-5 ( Fig. 4B ) both inhibited human HMEC-1 endothelial cell migration to fibronectin ( Fig. 4C ) , whereas FBLN-5 , but not FBLN-3 , mediated their adhesion in an RGD @-@ dependent manner ( Fig. 4D ; refs .
Figure 5A shows that bFGF stimulated significant vascularization of implanted Matrigel plugs , which was quantified by measuring plug hemoglobin contents ( Fig. 5A ) and microvessel densities ( Fig. 5B ) .
More importantly , tumors derived from FBLN @-@ expressing MCA102 fibrosarcoma cells also exhibited significantly reduced blood vessel densities compared with tumors derived from control cells ( Fig. 6D ) .
In addition , FBLN-3 @-@ expressing MCA102 tumors contained significantly enlarged regions of central and peripheral necrosis that were typically absent in their control counterparts .
The TLR3 agonist poly ( I : C ) significantly increased bidirectional secretion of CCL2 , IL6 , TNFA and CSF2 and basolateral secretion of CSF3 .
To verify the absence of the STAT6 @-@ signaling cascade in STAT6 -/- MLF , we assessed mOSM and mIL-4 induced responses with respect to STAT3 and STAT6 activation . Fig. 6 confirms the absence of STAT6 protein and STAT6 induction in STAT6 -/- MLF but equivalent activation of STAT3 in both wt and STAT6 -/- MLF .
Twenty @-@ four hour stimulation with 25.0 ng @/@ ml mOSM induced detectable increases in eotaxin-1 expression at the mRNA and protein level in both wt and STAT6 -/- MLF ( Fig. 5 , A and C ) . Stimulation of wt MLF using 10.0 ng @/@ ml mIL-4 induced eotaxin mRNA expression and protein production that was nondetectable in STAT6 -/- MLF ( Fig. 5 , A and C )
We and others have shown that OSM can induce eotaxin-1 in mouse lung fibroblasts ( MLF ) ( 28 ) and lung smooth muscle cells ( 29 ) .
We also compared the effects of mOSM on IL-6 expression in both wt and STAT6 -/- MLF ( Fig. 5 , B and D ) and show that STAT6 -/- MLF respond similarly to wt MLF in IL-6 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels .
mOSM induced STAT1 ( Y701 ) , STAT3 ( Y705 ) , and STAT5 ( Y694 ) phosphorylation as reported by others ( 57 , 58 , 59 ) .
Levels of VCAM-1 in STAT-6 @-@ deficient MLF were somewhat reduced compared with those observed in wt MLF , however , the ability of mOSM or mTNF- { alpha } to induce VCAM-1 was maintained ( Fig. 7B ) .
IL-4 has been documented to regulate the expression of eotaxin-1 ( 41 ) , eotaxin-2 ( 42 ) , and eotaxin-3 ( 34 ) in endothelial cells and fibroblasts in a STAT6 @-@ dependent manner ( 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 ) . IL-4 signal transduction includes activation of STAT6 ( 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ) .
To verify the absence of the STAT6 @-@ signaling cascade in STAT6 -/- MLF , we assessed mOSM and mIL-4 induced responses with respect to STAT3 and STAT6 activation . Fig. 6 confirms the absence of STAT6 protein and STAT6 induction in STAT6 -/- MLF but equivalent activation of STAT3 in both wt and STAT6 -/- MLF .
Levels of VCAM-1 in STAT-6 @-@ deficient MLF were somewhat reduced compared with those observed in wt MLF , however , the ability of mOSM or mTNF- { alpha } to induce VCAM-1 was maintained ( Fig. 7B ) .
Focus formation was consistently observed with both mutants . However , C-RAF mutant proteins caused the formation of much smaller cell aggregates ( Fig. 5A ) as compared with v-Raf .
Wild-type MEFs induced Ifnb , Tnfa , and Il-6 in response to poly ( I : C ) { an viral mimetic activator of FADD signaling @-@ SE } , whereas the induction was severely impaired in FADD @-@ deficient MEFs as examined by RT-PCR analyses ( Fig. 1A ) .
the induction of Tnfa and Il-6 was severely impaired after 2 h of poly ( I : C ) stimulation and reduced after 6 h of stimulation in caspase-8 @-@ deficient cells ( Fig. 4B ) .
nuclear translocation of p65 , a component of NF- { kappa } B , was reduced in caspase-8 @-@ deficient cells ( Fig. 4C )
LMW @-@ DSP2 overexpression in 293T cells suppressed IL-6 @-@ induced phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 .
In contrast , small @-@ interfering RNA @-@ mediated reduction of LMW @-@ DSP2 expression enhanced IL-6 @-@ induced STAT3 @-@ dependent transcription .
Expression of wild-type ( wt ) Cbp remarkably suppressed EGF @-@ induced activation of Src , ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , and Akt-1 enzymes , and NIH3T3 cell transformation , as well as colony formation of a breast cancer cell line ( MDA @-@ MB-468 ) in soft agar .
Interestingly , 500 ng @/@ ml GH and 30 ng @/@ ml IL-6 increased PAI-1 secretion five @-@ fold and 3.6 @-@ fold , respectively . Furthermore , GH and IL-6 induced PAI-1 mRNA by up to 7.3 @-@ fold , and 3.6 @-@ fold , respectively , in a time @-@ dependent fashion with significant stimulation seen at concentrations as low as 5 ng @/@ ml GH and 10 ng @/@ ml IL-6 .
RNA interference @-@ mediated inhibition of TLR2 and MyD88 expression in C2C12 muscle cells resulted in a near complete inhibition of palmitate @-@ induced insulin resistance and IL-6 production .
When compared with an equimolar concentration of palmitate , fibroblast @-@ stimulating lipopeptide-1 , a known TLR2 ligand , was a slightly more potent activator of signal transduction and interleukin ( IL ) - 6 production .
When c-H-ras expression was induced with heavy metal ions there was a marked reduction in the expression of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchored proteins , TAP @/@ Ly @-@ 6A.2 and Thy-1 , on the plasma membrane of the transformed cells .
We demonstrate that siRNA targeting ULK2 in mouse P19 cells results in elevated FGFR1 mediated FRS3 and SHP2 tyrosyl phosphorylation .
PGD ( 2 ) induced a reduction in adiponectin and leptin mRNA , and the secretion of these adipokines was also inhibited , the effect being greater with leptin ( up to 10 @-@ fold ) than with adiponectin ( twofold ) .
In contrast , PGD ( 2 ) induced a marked stimulation of IL-6 and MCP-1 expression ; with IL-6 , this was rapid , the mRNA level increasing by > 50 @-@ fold by 1 h . The rise in mRNA was accompanied by an increase in IL-6 and MCP-1 release ( up to 100 @- and 6.5 @-@ fold , respectively ) .
IL-13 increased Egr-1 mRNA levels in a biphasic manner in Stat6 @/@ fibroblasts ; early induction of Egr-1 mRNA was observed 30 min following exposure to IL-13 and declined after 3 @–@ 6 h ( Fig. 6A ) . Egr-1 protein was increased in Stat6 @/@ fibroblasts as compared with Stat6 @/@ fibroblasts from 30 min to 3 h after IL-13 treatment ( Fig. 6 , B and C ) .
PDGF @-@ AA immunostaining was strongly expressed in the lungs of IL-13 transgene @-@ positive mice and localized to the airway epithelium , airway smooth muscle , and interstitial cells ( Fig. 1 , B–E ) .
PDGF @-@ CC immunostaining was strongly expressed in the lungs of IL-13 transgene @-@ positive mice and localized to airway epithelium , type II pneumocytes , alveolar macrophages , and fibroblasts ( Fig. 1G ) .
we observed that IL-13 caused tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in Stat6 @/@ and Stat6 @/@ fibroblasts ( Fig. 3 , A and C ) .
Next , we observed that Stat6 was tyrosine phosphorylated in Stat1 @/@ and Stat1 @/@ fibroblasts ( Fig. 3 , B and D ) .

Egr-1 has been characterized as a transcriptional regulator of both PDGF-A and PDGF-C gene expression ( 18 , 19 ) .
Western blot analysis demonstrated that PD98059 blocked IL-13 @-@ induced phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( Fig. 8A ) yet enhanced the phosphorylation of Stat6 and increased protein expression of Egr-1 in a time @-@ dependent manner after IL-13 treatment ( Fig. 8 , B and C ) .
In cycling cells , the effects of Nox1 were dose dependent : levels of Nox1 that induced 3 @- to 10 @-@ fold increases in ROS promoted phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and expression of cyclin D1 ,
Induction of STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations by Galpha ( s ) QL was suppressed by inhibition of protein kinase A , Janus kinase 2 @/@ 3 , Rac1 , c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) , or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and a similar profile was observed in response to beta2 @-@ adrenergic receptor stimulation
Activated KRAS is known to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin , leading to its release from E-cadherin at the adherens junction
TNF-a strongly stimulated FRA-1 promoter activity in WT MEFs as compared with the erk1 -/- MEFs ( Fig. 9B ) .
the recruitment of c-Jun was strongly enhanced following TNF-a treatment ( Fig. 10B , lanes 3 and 4 ) . In contrast , the binding of c-Jun to the fra-1 promoter was significantly diminished in MEFS lacking the erk1 -/- signaling ( cf lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 3 and 4 ) .
As shown in Fig. 9A , TNF-a strongly stimulated both ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation in WT cells ( cf lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The -@ 318 TRE mediates c-Jun @-@ dependent , TNF-alpha @-@ inducible FRA-1 promoter activity ..... Consistent with this result , ectopic expression of a c-Jun mutant lacking the transactivation domain greatly reduced ( ~ 80 % ) TNF-alpha @-@ stimulated promoter activity ( Fig. 2B ) .... However , TNF-a induced the binding of c-Jun to the promoter as early as 30 min ( Fig. 3A , lane 2 ) , and it remained high through 60 min ( Fig. 3A , lane 3 ) .
Real-time RT-PCR revealed that IL-1 beta induced SYN expression at the transcriptional level , because the mRNA level of SYN was upregulated by IL-1 ? . TNF @- ? had a weaker effect on SYN transcription , whereas IL-6 had no effect
STAT3 is also able to prevent cell death through inhibition of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway . This pathway is activated upon binding of extracellular ligands such as FAS ligand ( FAS-L ) to cell @-@ surface death receptors . Upon interaction with FAS-L , the FAS death receptor induces cell death through caspase-8 activation and truncation of the death agonist BID .
These genes can be divided in three classes : one that controls cell @-@ cycle arrest and senescence , one that controls apoptosis and one that regulates glucose metabolism and autophagy [ 42 ] . p53 is essentially known as a pro @-@ apoptotic transcription factor that upregulates the expression of proteins such as BCL2 @-@ associated X protein ( BAX ) , p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis ( PUMA ) or NOXA .
that IL-6 and IL-10 , two cytokines that are known to activate STAT3 , confer a drug @-@ resistant phenotype in renal carcinomas , which was subsequently confirmed in different cancer cell lines such as multiple myeloma [ 72,73 ] .
Importantly , the expression of survivin correlates with STAT3 activation in breast tumors , and the inhibition of this signaling pathway induces apoptosis [ 47,48 ] . Finally , it has also been shown that AKT is a direct target gene of STAT3 , which binds directly to its promoter to enhance its expression [ 49 ] .
Several transcription factors have also been implicated in megakaryopoiesis including , GATA-1 , friend of GATA-1 ( FOG-1 ) , nuclear factor @-@ erythroid 2 ( NF-E2 ) , and Fli-1 .
Tyk2 , along with JAK2 , does appear to regulate TPO receptor localization at the plasma membrane by stimulating recycling and enhancing the stability of the receptor in Ba @/@ F3 cells
Other notable genes downregulated with GATA-1 knockdown are the p45 subunit of nuclear factor erythroid @-@ derived 2 ( NF @- E2 ) , JAK2 , and beta1-tubulin .
There are two isoforms of 3 beta @- HSD expressed in wild-type megakaryocytes ( I and VI ) , but neither are expressed in NF-E2 null megakaryocytes .
TPO is necessary for megakaryocyte maturation in that TPO deficient mice display greatly reduced megakaryocyte production as well as reduced numbers of mature megakaryocytes
TPO to c-Mpl ( a receptor tyrosine kinase ) activates both Janus Kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) and Tyk2
. Furthermore , the bFGF @-@ induced activation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 seems to enhance the transcriptional activity of STAT3 . Co-stimulation of KMS-11 with bFGF and IL-6 leads to marked expression of STAT3 target genes , such as c-myc and bcl-2 , further suggesting the relevance of STAT3 phosphorylated at both Tyr705 and Ser727 for the full activation as a transcription factor ( Fig. 5 ) . In addition , the
Expression of PGC-1 ? , PEPCK , and glucose-6-phosphatase mRNAs were also significantly increased in fasted KO compared with fasted WT livers ( Table 2 ) , consistent with enhanced glucose production in KO livers .
As analyzed by real-time RT-PCR , levels of SOCS-3 mRNA and mRNAs of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF @- ? , and plasminogen activator inhibitor–1 ( PAI-1 ) were increased in fasted KO liver ( Table 2 ) .
In addition , expression of tribbles 3 ( TRB3 ) protein ( Figure 8C ) and mRNA ( Table 2 ) was increased in fasted KO livers .
mTORC2 can be activated by PI3K directly and phosphorylates Akt at S473 , which together with phosphorylation at T308 results in the full activation of Akt [ 12,13 ] .
The intracellular signaling induced by IL-4 @/@ IL-4R interactions on CD4 T cells has been characterized in great detail . The binding of IL-4 to the Type I receptor in CD4 T cells induces the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Jak1 , which promotes the phosphorylation of STAT6 .
Marimastat ( 100 mg @/@ kg ) , dexamethasone ( 10 mg @/@ kg ) and rolipram ( 0.3 mg @/@ kg ) reduced significantly IL-6 , KC @/@ CXCL1 , MIP-1 alpha @/@ CCL3 and MMP-9 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid .
Nox1 and Nox4 mRNAs were upregulated in H-RasV12 @-@ transformed p38 ??/? MEFs , suggesting that these two NOX family members may be involved in H-RasV12 @-@ induced ROS production in fibroblasts ( Figure S5B ) .
Papillary adenomas ( 1.2.1.2.2 ) were detected 6 @–@ 8 wk after BRafVE expression and appeared to increase in number and size . These lesions were bronchiolocentric , but did not appear to involve the terminal bronchioles . Rather , the lesions appeared to arise in alveolar ducts and expand outward and around bronchioles ( Fig. 4B ) .
At early times after induced BRafVE expression , we detected evidence of epithelial hyperplasia ( classified as 1.1.1.1 ) arising within the terminal bronchioles and within the central lung parenchyma .
the majority of cells within BRafVE @-@ induced tumors expressed SP-C , suggesting that they have properties of ATII pneumocytes ( Fig. 2K , L ) .
It is reported that KRasG12D @-@ induced lung tumors do not routinely display elevated pERK1 @/@ pERK2 but display stress @-@ activated MAP kinase ( SAPK @/@ JNK ) activation ( Lee et al. 2002 ) ... Interestingly , the major difference appears to be that expression of KRasG12D in the lung leads to more rapid and consistent progression to adenocarcinoma than that elicited by BRafVE .
from full text - As shown in Fig. 1A , ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in wild-type MEFs is phosphorylated after IGF-1 stimulation with a peak at 5 @–@ 10 min , after which pERK declined substantially . In b-arrestin1 KO MEFs , on the other hand , ERK1 @/@ ERK2 remained essentially inactivated upon IGF-1 stimulation ( Fig. 1A ) .
from full text - Similarly , we find that both b-arrestin1 and 2 are ubiquitinated in IGF-1 @-@ stimulated WT MEF cells .
the preincubation of RAW264.7 cells with a specific PPARalpha agonist , K-111 ( 2,2 @-@ dichloro-12- ( 4-chlorophenyl ) dodecanoic acid ) . K-111 reduced both the IL-6 production and mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells
Since activation of NF-B in A549 cells is dependent on IKK2 , which phosphorylates serines 32 and 36 of IB as a prelude to IB degradation and activation of NF-B ( Catley et al. , 2005
Thus , IL-6 release was substantially increased by both IL-1 and to a lesser extent by TNF . In each case , prior infection with the null adenovirus showed no significant effect , whereas dominant IBN reduced IL-6 release to near @-@ background levels . Likewise , the dominant @-@ negative IKK2 adenovirus prevented IL-6 release
Similar levels of RANTES and MCP-1 release were induced by IL-1 and TNF treatments . However , the induction of IL-6 , IL-8 , and GMCSF by TNF was 50 to 80 % lower than for IL-1 , whereas TNF @-@ induced GRO was some 35 @- to 40 @-@ fold lower than that for IL-1 . In all instances , preincubation with PS-1145 or ML120B resulted in a significant attenuation of cytokine release ( Fig. 6 ) .
Exposure of CD40L enhanced the constitutive production of IL-6 and MCP-1 protein ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Figure 1 TRF2 ( myc @-@ tagged ) induces telomere dysfunction and cellular senescence in p53 P/P primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts .
overexpression of TRF2 in p53 P/P MEFs resulted in upregulation of p21 ( Fig 1D ) . In addition , reduction of BrdU incorporation , induction of p21 level and increased number of SA-beta @-@ gal @-@ positive senescent cells were also observed when oncogenic H-Ras was overexpressed in p53 P/P MEFs ( Fig 1A ? C ) .
In addition , i.p. administration of UA increased the levels of IL-1 beta secretion and MPO activity in colonic mucosa of ICR mice .
UA increased the protein release of IL-1 beta , IL-6 , and MIF , but not of TNF-alpha , in dose @- and time @-@ dependent manners .
As shown in Fig. 3 , A and B , IL-1B mRNA and proIL-1B protein were detected in a constitutive manner at low levels in nontreated pMphi . Those treated with 4 microM UA for 3 and 6 h were markedly up-regulated , whereas , intriguingly , the levels diminished after 12 h .
JAK-2 activation and phosphorylation have been demonstrated in response to exogenous H2O2 in fibroblasts and VSMCs , respectively ( 27,63 ) .
in view of the ability of H2O2 to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPases ) , such as PTP-1B ( 68 ) , and SH-2 domain @-@ containing tyrosine phosphatase ( SHP ) - 2 ( 69 ) ,
c-Src has also been shown to be activated in response to ROS , including H2O2 , in different cell types ( 19,20 , 33,37,50 ) .
deletion of p38 alpha mitogen @-@ activated protein ( MAP ) kinase in adult mice results in increased proliferation
In addition , p38 alpha controls self @-@ renewal of the lung stem and progenitor cell population by inhibiting proliferation @-@ inducing signals , most notably epidermal growth factor receptor
We found that p38 alpha positively regulates factors such as CCAAT @/@ enhancer @-@ binding protein that are required for lung cell differentiation .
The reduction in C @/@ EBPa could be accounted for by lower levels of phospho-C @/@ EBPb ( Fig. 3a ) , a known target for p38a ( refs . 12,20 ) , which in turn regulates the expression of C @/@ EBPa ( ref . 21 ) .
Mnk1 was also activated at lower levels in Mapk14 @-@ null mice ( Fig. 3b ) . This p38a @-@ activated protein kinase phosphorylates and stabilizes Sprouty2 ( ref . 26 ) , which in turn can negatively regulate tyrosine kinase receptor signaling in lung cells27 .
Our results indicated that the p38a @-@ deficient lungs had hyperproliferative alveolar tissue with loss of differentiation markers . A similar but more marked lung phenotype , with hyperproliferation and defective cell maturation , has been described previously in CCAAT @/@ enhancer @-@ binding protein ( C/EBP ) a knockout mice , which die shortly after birth because of respiratory failure16 @–@ 18 .
the amount of Tgfb1 ( TGFb ) mRNA was higher in p38a @-@ deficient lungs compared with Mapk14D/+ lungs ( Fig. 3e ) . TGFb has been found to be overexpressed in C @/@ EBPa knockout lungs17 , so the reduced C @/@ EBPa levels in the Mapk14 @-@ null lungs could account for the higher TGFb expression .
Expression of KrasG12V induced also a loss of epithelial markers ( as assessed by E-cadherin staining , which was similar in Mapk14D/+ and Mapk14D @/@ D alveoli ; Fig. 6c ) and an increase in SP @-@ C+ cells ( Fig. 6d ) .
However , the SP @-@ C+ cells were more numerous in the Mapk14 -/- lungs ( with almost twice as many as in Mapk14 -/+ lungs ; Fig. 2c ) . Notably , immunohistological staining showed reduced levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in the alveolar cells ( Fig. 2c ) , indicating defective differentiation of these cells .
Notably , we found that p38a @-@ deficient lungs contained lower levels of C @/@ EBPa and HNF3b , another transcription factor involved in lung differentiation whose expression is controlled by C @/@ EBPa ( ref . 19 ) ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 1a online ) .
Furthermore , the higher number of AT2 cells correlated with an almost fivefold increase in Ki67+ cells in Mapk14 -/- lungs compared with the number of Ki67+ cells in their heterozygous Mapk14D/+ counterparts ( Fig. 2d ) .
We also detected a reduction in STAT3 protein in Mapk14D @/@ D lungs ( Fig. 3a ) that correlated with the reduction in Il6 mRNA ( Fig. 3 ) .
three times as much Egfr mRNA was present in Mapk14D @/@ D lungs ( Fig. 3d ) compared with Mapk14D/+ lungs , suggesting that EGFR expression was transcriptionally enhanced in the absence of p38a .
Notably , EGFR transcription is regulated by AP-1 ( ref . 28 ) , and we observed higher levels of phospho-c-Jun , one of the AP-1 components , in the p38a @-@ deficient lungs ( Fig. 3c ) , suggesting that p38a downregulation might activate AP-1 .
Furthermore , inactivation of JNK or c-Jun suppressed the increased proliferation of Mapk14 @-@ deficient hepatocytes and tumor cells .
Upon stimulation with TLR ligands , p105 is phosphorylated by I kappa B kinase ( IKK ) complex and partially degraded , which releases TPL2 . The free TPL2 is active and stimulates the ERK pathway via MEK1 @/@ MEK2 .
Angiopoietin-1 stimulates association of SHP-2 to the phosphorylated Tie-2 receptor ( 47 ) , which in turn inhibits PI3 kinase @-@ dependent signaling pathways leading to EC migration .
Overexpression of dominant negative N17Rac1 significantly inhibits VEGF @-@ induced ROS production that is involved in VEGFR2 activation , EC migration , and proliferation ( 100 ) .
VEGFR2 forms a complex with VE-cadherin , -@ catenin , and PI3 kinase that is required for phosphorylation of Akt , which plays an important role in EC survival ( 15 ) and migration ( 27 , 28 , 80 ) .

Aortas from COX-2 ?/? mice on atherogenic diet after 3 weeks had significantly larger areas of neutral lipid content as measured by Oil Red O staining ( Fig. 1A ) .
Serum TXB2 is significantly increased in COX-2 ?/? mice on chow compared to wild-type littermates ( Fig. 4A ) .
Interestingly , COX-2 ?/? mice on atherogenic diet showed more systemic inflammation with higher levels of TNF ( Fig. 5B ) and IL-6 ( Fig. 5D ) than wild-type controls . Furthermore , IL-12 was significantly increased by atherogenic diet in wild-type controls , while COX-2 depletion completely abolished this induction ( Fig. 5E ) .

Flow cytometry confirmed that follicular B cells present in Itpkb ?/? and Itpkb ?/? E ? -@ 2 @–@ 22 BCL-2 mice expressed a higher level of Bim protein .
Erk1 and Erk2 were found to be much less phosphorylated in Itpkb ?/? E ? -@ 2 ? 22 @-@ BCL-2 B cells than in control B cells after BCR activation ( Fig. 3 b ) .
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed a slight , but very significant , increase in Bim messenger RNA level in splenic resting follicular B cells persisting in Itpkb ?/? mice .
The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 is highly expressed in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells ( Treg ) and was recently identified as a key player in mediating their inhibitory functions .
Foxp3 expression was induced by transforming growth factor- ( 32 ( TGF- ( 32 ) , but not TGF- ( 31 stimulation in these cells , and was partially suppressed following antibody @-@ mediated neutralization of TGF- ( 32 .
Down-regulation of Foxp3 with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) in pancreatic carcinoma cells resulted in the up-regulation of interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) and IL-8 expression , providing evidence for a negative transcriptional activity of Foxp3 also in these epithelial cells .
Coculture of Foxp3 @-@ expressing tumor cells with naive T cells completely inhibited T-cell proliferation , but not activation , and this antiproliferative effect was partially abrogated following specific inhibition of Foxp3 expression .
In an initial analysis of microdissected pancreatic carcinoma tissue using Affymetrix chip technology , Foxp3 was among the up-regulated genes in some tumor samples ( 26 ) ; ( Fig. 1A ) .
In accordance with the immunohistochemistry data pointing to FoxP3 expression in tumor cells ( see above ) , Foxp3 expression was clearly detectable in several pancreatic carcinoma cell lines at both mRNA ( Fig. 2A ) and protein levels ( Fig. 2B ) .
Treatment of PANC-89 , Capan1 , and Panc1 cells with TGF-h2 led to an up-regulation of the Foxp3 protein , which was moderate for PANC-89 and Capan1 and strong for Panc1 ( Fig. 3A and D ) .
RT-PCR analysis detected a 13 @-@ fold ( mean value of four independent experiments ) increase of Foxp3 mRNA expression in PANC-89 cells after a 48-h stimulation with TGF-h2 , whereas no such effect was evident after stimulation with TGF-h1 ( Fig. 3B ) .
Moreover , the incubation of PANC-89 and Capan1 cells with anti @-@ TGF-h2 antibody for 48 h clearly suppressed the Foxp3 signal ( Fig. 3A ) , suggesting that endogenously produced TGF-h2 maintains Foxp3 expression in pancreatic cancer cell cultures .
Specific down-regulation of Foxp3 in pancreatic carcinoma cells results in up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 .
A screen for changes in cytokine secretion in these cells using the Raybiotec Cytokine Array ( Hoelzel Diagnostica ) revealed an increase of IL-6 and IL-8 in the culture supernatant , whereas other cytokines remained unchanged ( data not shown ) .
In the cocultures , Colo357 , PANC-89 , and PancTu1 tumor cells strongly inhibited the proliferation of anti @-@ CD3 @/@ anti @-@ CD28 @-@ stimulated T cells ( Fig. 4D ) .
As shown in Fig. 5B , CD25 GITR and CD69 were up-regulated after anti @-@ CD3 @/@ anti @-@ CD28 stimulation , irrespective of the presence or absence of tumor cells .
When using these cells , we observed an ~ 45 % recovery of T-cell proliferation in the coculture system ( Fig. 5A ) .
Results Tumor @-@ associated inflammation is reduced in IL-1R —/— mice .
Canonical proinflammatory cytokines , such as IL-6 , MCP-1 , TGFh , and IL-1h were significantly elevated in 4T1 tumor tissue .
Additionally , IL-1R —/— tumor tissue had less IL-12p70 and more TGFh and IFNg than tumor tissue from wild-type BALB @/@ c mice .
A potential downstream candidate is the proinflammatory cytokine , IL-6 , the production of which is reduced in IL-1R —/— tumor tissue ( Fig. 1B ) .
These data demonstrate that it is the hemin @-@ induced surge in cellular ROS levels , in particular the superoxide generated most likely from NADPH oxidase activity , and consequent oxidative stress which mediates Egr-1 upregulation via ERK-1 @/@ ERK-2 activation .
However , RELMbeta stimulated naive bone marrow @-@ derived macrophages to secrete significant amounts of TNF-alpha , IL-6 , and RANTES
MMP-2 ( 76 kDa ) activity was elevated only at day 11 in C57BL @/@ 6 mice but not in MyD88 –/– and IL-1R1 –/– mice ( Figure 4B ) .
MMP-9 activity was significantly upregulated in BALF at day 1 in C57BL @/@ 6 mice but not in MyD88 –/– mice , and only partially in IL-1R1 –/– mice ( Figure 4A ) .
Latent TGF @- ? 1 was detected after activation in BALF from WT mice 7 days after BLM administration , but was not detected in BALF from MyD88 @- or IL-1R1 @–@ deficient mice ( Figure 5G )
7 days of administration IL-1 ? caused tissue injury with marked tissue destruction , disruption of alveolar architecture , inflammation , and fibrosis ( although less pronounced than that obtained after BLM treatment ; Figure 7 , D and E ) that was absent in saline controls ( Figure 7C )
IL-1 ? production into the lung was attenuated in ASC –/– in comparison with ASC +/+ control littermates 24 hours after BLM administration ( Figure 9D ) .
IL-6 production into the lung 24 hours after BLM treatment was attenuated in ASC –/– in comparison with ASC +/+ control littermates ( Figure 9E ) . Comparable reductions of IL-1 ? and IL-6 were obtained in the BALF
Studies using bone marrow @-@ derived macrophages ( BMDM ) isolated from a spontaneous mouse model of Crohn 's disease @-@ like ileitis ( SAMP1 @/@ YitFc strain ) revealed significant inhibition by CGP57380 of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF , IL-6 , and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 at 4 and 24 h after LPS stimulation
Co-immunoprecipitation studies with H-Ras @-@ transformed cells revealed that Spry2 and H-Ras interact and that H-Ras interacts with Spry2 @-@ binding partners , c-Cbl and CIN85 , in a Spry2 @-@ dependent manner .
We compared human fibroblasts malignantly transformed by overexpression of H-Ras ( V12 ) oncogene to their nontransformed parental cells and found that the malignant cells express a high level of Spry2 .
When we decreased expression of Spry2 , using a Spry2 @-@ specific shRNA , the H-Ras ( V12 ) - transformed fibroblasts could no longer form large colonies in agarose , grow in reduced levels of serum , or form tumors in athymic mice . The level of active H-Ras in these cells remained unaltered .
We next determined whether the ? EGFR @-@ expressing MCF-10A cells produced high levels of IL-6 , leading to activation of STAT3 , as was observed in lung adenocarcinoma @–@ derived cell lines harboring mutant EGFR . The ? EGFR @–@ MCF-10A cells were treated with P6 , gp130 , and IL-6 blocking antibodies , which inhibited STAT3 activation .
In contrast , enhanced thrombopoietin signaling , conferred by enforced expression of constitutively active JAK2 or c-MPL , induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 , but not STAT1 , and failed to rescue megakaryocyte maturation .
We show that ectopic expression of STAT1 or its downstream transcriptional target IRF-1 promotes features of megakaryocytic differentiation of G1ME cells , a Gata1 @-@ null erythromegakaryocytic cell line ( 25 ) ,
In most cell types , STAT1 is primarily triggered by interferon signaling ( 21 ) . However , TPO signaling phosphorylates STAT1 in WT megakaryocytes ( 10 ) .
Moreover , GATA-1 transactivated the Stat1 promoter in luciferase reporter assays ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . STAT1 and IRF-1 reciprocally activated each other ’s transcription , as previously reported ( Figure ? ( Figure1D1D and Supplemental Table 1 ; also reviewed in ref . 26 ) .
In addition , STAT1 or IRF-1 induced the expression of CD42 , a late marker of megakaryocyte maturation , albeit to a much lesser extent than GATA-1 ( Figure ? ( Figure 1C ) .1C ) .
enforced STAT1 expression promoted several features of megakaryocytic differentiation of G1ME cells , as evidenced by increased cell size ( forward scatter ) and increased DNA content , reflecting polyploidization ( Figure ? ( Figure1,1 , A and B ) . Similar effects were produced by enforced expression of IRF-1 , a major STAT1 effector ( reviewed in ref . 26 ) .
Second , mice deficient for both STAT5A and STAT5B are thrombocytopenic , likely due to a reduction in functional hematopoietic progenitors ( 18 ) .
TPO functions through binding its receptor , c-Mpl , to activate JAK2 , STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT5 in megakaryocytes and other hematopoietic cells ( 10 @–@ 12 ) .
enforced STAT1 expression promoted several features of megakaryocytic differentiation of G1ME cells , as evidenced by increased cell size ( forward scatter ) and increased DNA content , reflecting polyploidization ( Figure ? ( Figure1,1 , A and B ) . Similar effects were produced by enforced expression of IRF-1 , a major STAT1 effector ( reviewed in ref . 26 ) .
Although inhibitors of PKC had no effect on this suppression , MAPK inhibitors completely prevented the TPA effect . RasGRP1 activates the MAPK pathway through activation of the small G protein H-Ras .
Functional assessment of NCC by using thiazide @-@ sensitive ( 22 ) Na ( + ) uptakes revealed that TPA completely suppresses NCC function . Biotinylation experiments demonstrated that this result was primarily because of decreased surface expression of NCC .
Expression of all proinflammatory @/@ profibrotic mediators as assessed by reverse transcriptase @-@ PCR and densitometry was less in Lenti @-@ IL-10 @-@ injected wounds compared with Lenti @-@ GFP @-@ injected wounds , with the difference in the expression of IL-6 , MCP-1 , and HSP47 reaching statistical significance ( Figure 5 ) .
observations that inhibition of PI3K or EGF-R is sufficient to prevent terminal differentiation in keratinocytes in suspension ( Rodeck et al. , 1997 ; Nikolopoulos et al. , 2005 ) , and that function disrupting antibodies to E-cadherin abrogate Akt phosphorylation inducing growth arrest and terminal differentiation in conventional submerged mouse keratinocyte cultures at confluency ( Calautti et al. , 2005 ) .
In vivo , b4-integrin amplifies proproliferative signals in basal epidermal keratinocytes ( Nikolopoulos et al. , 2005 ) , where STAT3 is expressed and can be activated by EGF @/@ EGF-R ( Nishio et al. , 2001 ; Chan et al. , 2004 ; Li et al. , 2007 )
Src @-@ family kinases then phosphorylate the plaque proteins b-catenin , plakoglobin , p120 cnt , and acatenin , which is required for their association with the E-cadherin tail ( Calautti et al. , 1998 , 2005 ) .
JNK2 might potentially be activated via Src kinasemediated phosphorylation of EGF-R on Tyr920 ( Calautti et al. , 2005 ) ,
b1-integrin phosphorylation by Src results in EGF-R activation ( Miranti and Brugge , 2002 ) , and b1-integrin expression is required for the initiation of mouse mammary tumors expressing the polyoma virus middle T antigen ( White et al. , 2004 ) .
E-cadherin gene deletion , which results in some hyperproliferation in the epidermis ( Young et al. , 2003 ; Tinkle et al. , 2004 ; Tunggal et al. , 2005 ) .
E-cadherinknockout epidermis displays some hyperproliferation , which however appears to be limited due to compensatory upregulation of P-cadherin ( Young et al. , 2003 ; Tinkle et al. , 2004 ; Tunggal et al. , 2005 )
Recently reported in A431 cells , this can occur through E-cadherin @-@ mediated inhibition of transphosphorylation on Tyr845EGF-R ( Perrais et al. , 2007 ) , the site , which catalyzes EGF @-@ induced mitogenesis ( Ishizawar and Parsons , 2004 ) .
In mouse keratinocytes , Src kinase @-@ mediated phosphorylation was found to generate a docking site for PI3K ( p85 ) on plakoglobin in an EGF-R @-@ dependent manner , to a minor extent on p120 cnt , but not on b-catenin , which apparently lacks a PI3K ( p85 ) - docking motive ( Calautti et al. , 2005 ) .
Transgenic mice ( both newborn and adult ) expressing the signalingdefective b4-integrin mutant showed a twofold decrease in the epidermal proliferative index , confirming that b4-integrin actually contributes to proliferation ( Nikolopoulos et al. , 2005 ) .
b4-integrin mediates the phosphorylation of ErbB2 on Tyr877 by a Src @-@ family kinase .... ( Ishizawar and Parsons , 2004 ) .
In parallel to JNK , two other MAPKs , ERK1 and ERK2 , were also found to be targeted to the nucleus in a b4 @-@ integrindependent manner in keratinocytes ( Nikolopoulos et al. , 2005 ) .
plakoglobin @-@ mediated suppression of the pro @-@ proliferative proto @-@ oncogene c-Myc , which is critical for growth inhibition in these cells ( Arnold and Watt , 2001 ; Waikel et al. , 2001 ; Kolly et al. , 2005 ; Figure 2 ) .
JNK2 was found to be necessary for cell @-@ cycle arrest in keratinocytes , as exemplified by hyperproliferation of JNK2 @-@ knockout epidermis ( Sabapathy and Wagner , 2004 ; Weston et al. , 2004 ) .
In mouse keratinocytes , it was however shown to result in Src kinase @-@ mediated phosphorylation of EGF-R , presumably on Tyr920 ( Calautti et al. , 2005 ) .
In human HaCaT keratinocytes for instance , ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation increases in dependence of EGF-R recruitment to transadhering E-cadherin , and E-cadherin @-@ mediated activation of MAPK was also reported in intestinal epithelial cells ( Pece and Gutkind , 2000 ; Laprise et al. , 2004 ) .
Similar to AlkB , ABH2 and ABH3 have the ability to repair 1 meA and 3 meC residues . However , whereas ABH2 prefers double-stranded DNA , ABH3 and AlkB favour single-stranded DNA and RNA ( Aas et al , 2003 ; Falnes et al , 2004 ) .
A targeted Brca1 @-@ null mutation to the T-cell lineage resulted in increased genomic instability , apoptosis , cell @-@ cycle arrest , and a drastic depletion of the T-cell lineage ( Mak et al , 2000 ) .
null mutations for Brca2 result in early mouse embryonic lethality and impaired HR ( Ludwig et al , 1997 ; Suzuki et al , 1997 ; Moynahan et al , 2001 ) . Furthermore , loss of Brca2 in murine cells resulted in increased genomic instability and activation of p53 .
BRCA2 functions in the loading of the HR protein RAD51 during filament formation . It directly binds to RAD51 and its phosphorylation on Ser3291 inhibits this binding ( Esashi et al , 2005 ) .
The death of mutants such as Xrcc1 @/@ , LigIII @/@ and Polb @/@ was preceded by elevated levels of apoptosis ( Gu et al , 1994 ; Tebbs et al , 1999 ; Sugo et al , 2000 ; Puebla @-@ Osorio et al , 2006 ) .
( McPherson et al , 2004a ) . Heterozygous and homozygous Mus81 mutants show cancer predisposition , particularly to T @- and B-cell lymphomas .
after a long latency , Ung @/@ and Mutyh @/@ mice developed B-cell lymphomas and intestinal tumors , respectively ( Nilsen et al , 2003 ; Sakamoto et al , 2007 ) .
Increased apoptosis and proliferative arrest of pro-B cells in Ku80 @/@ mice were rescued by a p53 @-@ null background ( Difilippantonio et al , 2000 ) .
The consequential loss of CDC25A results in G1 @/@ S arrest , due to the inefficient loading of CDC45 at the origin of replication . In addition , activated ATM , ATR , DNA @–@ PK , Chk2 , and Chk1 all aid in the phosphorylation and activation of p53 , a key player in DNA @-@ damage checkpoints . Activated p53 transactivates p21 , which inhibits two G1 @/@ S @-@ promoting cyclin @-@ dependent kinases ( CDKs ) , CDK2 and CDK4 .
Activated ATM and ATR mediate the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Chk2 and Chk1 , respectively ; this process is necessary in the induction of phosphorylation of CDC25A , marking it for proteosomal degradation ( Su , 2006 ) .
Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 , S6k1 ( Thr ( 389 ) ) , and Erk 1 @/@ 2 was reduced 2 h following IP injection of alcohol .
TGF-beta @-@ induced Foxp3 expression is inhibited by IL-6 ( ref . 17 ) , IL-21 ( ref . 10 ) and IL-23 ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) .
Forced expression of wild-type mouse Foxp3 inhibited IL-6 @/@ IL-21 @-@ induced Il23r expression , whereas Foxp3DeltaEx2 had less inhibitory activity ( Fig. 4a )
Both mouse and human Foxp3 blocked RORgammat @-@ directed IL-17 expression , but full suppression required the presence of the exon 2 @-@ encoded sequence in Foxp3 , suggesting that the interaction between Foxp3 and RORgammat is essential ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5 ) .
Examination of IL-17 expression in heterozygous RORgammat @–@ GFP knock @-@ in mice revealed that RORgammat+Foxp3+ lamina propria T cells produced much less IL-17 than RORgammat+Foxp3 @- cells , suggesting that Foxp3 may interfere with the ability of RORgammat to induce IL-17 ( Fig. 1c ) .
A ) Increase in IL-6 production from baseline in WT , tlr4 @/@ , myd88 @/@ , and trif @/@ alveolar macrophages treated with LPS , BAL fluid from normal control , or BAL fluid from acid @-@ treated WT mice . **p < 0.01 . Data are from four separate experiments .
By contrast , LPS @-@ induced IL-6 production in alveolar macrophages was dependent on TLR4 , MyD88 , and TRIF ( Figure 3A ) .
IL-6 reduced the expression levels of Foxp3 at 48 @–@ 72 h . This is probably a direct effect of IL-6 on the Foxp3 promoter because IL-6 suppressed TGF @- ? 1 @-@ mediated Foxp3 promoter activity in primary T cells ( data not shown ) .
As shown in Fig. 4C , transient overexpression of WT Foxp3 , but not { Delta } 2 or { Delta } FKH , inhibited induction of IL-17A transcription ( Fig. 4C ) . Taken together , these observations suggest that Foxp3 interacts with ROR { gamma } t in the exon 2 region and that the FKH domain plays a critical role in the suppression of ROR { gamma } t @-@ mediated IL-17A transcription .
Then , IL-17A promoter activity was examined with or without an ROR { gamma } t expression vector in the HEK 293T cells in which ROR { gamma } t was not expressed . In the presence of ROR { gamma } t , the promoter activity was significantly increased ( Fig. 2A ) .
Germline expression of the endogenous H-RasG12V oncogene , even in homozygosis , resulted in hyperplasia of the mammary gland .
We investigated whether globular adiponectin ( gAd ) affects the expression of inflammation @-@ related genes in murine macrophages ( RAW264 cells ) . DNA microarray analysis indicated that granulocyte colony @-@ stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) showed the largest increase in expression in gAd @-@ stimulated RAW264 cells . The gAd @-@ induced secretion of G-CSF increased in a time @- and dose @-@ dependent manner .
gAd induced the phosphorylation of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in RAW264 cells . In addition , the gAd @-@ induced phosphorylation of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was dramatically reduced by PD98059 and U0126 , respectively .

To determine if XIAP enhanced proinflammatory gene expression in vivo , we performed qRT @-@ PCR analysis on splenic RNA from WT and XIAP knockout mice . RNA was isolated from splenocytes harvested from uninfected animals or animals infected with L . monocytogenes for 48 h ( Figure 6 ) { to activate XIAP } . The expression of il6 and ifng mRNAs were significantly enhanced in the presence of XIAP during infection .
Furthermore , the hydroxyproline content was significantly reduced in the anti @-@ CD154 mAb @–@ treated group compared with the control IgG– treated group ( Figure 5c ) .
In contrast , the number of BrdU @-@ positive proliferating dermal fibroblasts at 1 week was significantly reduced in the anti @-@ CD154 mAb @–@ treated group compared with the control IgG @–@ treated group
In addition , the anti @-@ CD154 mAb treatment suppressed the up-regulated expression of COL1A1 , RANTES , and MCP-1 mRNA ( Figure 5g ) .
Upon stimulation with soluble CD154 , cultured fibroblasts induced to express CD40 by adenoviral gene transfer proliferated and showed up-regulation of the genes for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , IL-8 , monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) , and RANTES , as well as up-regulation of their proteins .
Consistent with diminished numbers of squamous type I cells in epFoxm1 -/- lungs , mRNA levels of T1-alpha and aquaporin 5 were significantly decreased as demonstrated by quantitative real-time ( RT-PCR ) ( qRT @-@ PCR ) analysis ( Fig. 3B ) .
Significantly decreased mRNA levels of M-phase @-@ promoting Cdc25B phosphatase ( Fig. 3B ) , a known transcriptional target of Foxm1 ( 15 ) , were observed in the lungs of epFoxm1 -/- mice .
The authors demonstrate that HMGB1 binds to TLR4 and that HMGB1 , which is released by chemotherapy @-@ induced cell death , can activate TLR4 and induce anti @-@ tumour T-cell immunity79 .
In response to hepatocyte cell death , MyD88 signalling was responsible for the activation of NF @- ? B and for the production of factors such as IL-6 ( ReF . 122 ) .
All TLRs ( except for TLR3 ) and IL-1 receptor family members signal through MyD88 .
We veri ? ed the secretion levels of several SASP proteins by ELISAs ( Figure S1 and Text S1 ) . Further , because secretion increased greater than 10 @-@ fold for some SASP factors , we could verify up-regulation by intracellular immunostaining . For example , IL-6 and IL-8 were barely visible in PRE cells but clearly detectable in SEN cells ( Figure 1B , Figure S2 , and Text S1 ) .
SASP components included inflammatory and immune @-@ modulatory cytokines and chemokines ( e.g. , IL-6 , ? 7 , and ? 8 , MCP-2 , and MIP-3a ) . They also included growth factors ( e.g. , GRO , HGF , and IGFBPs ) , shed cell surface molecules ( e.g. , ICAMs , uPAR , and TNF receptors ) , and survival factors ( Figure 1A and Table S2 )
Hypoxia exposure of IL-6 +/+ mice led to marked increases in IL-6 mRNA and protein levels within the first week , with positive IL-6 immunostaining in the pulmonary vessel walls ... In vitro studies of cultured human pulmonary @-@ artery smooth @-@ muscle @-@ cells ( PA @-@ SMCs ) and microvascular endothelial cells revealed prominent synthesis of IL-6 by PA @-@ SMCs , with further stimulation by hypoxia .
In CIA synoviocytes , IL-17 increased the expression of TLR-2 , 4 , and 9 , and this effect was significantly alleviated by neutralizing antibodies to IL-17 , IL-1 beta , and IL-6 .
CX3CR1 may also be of importance as it confers a survival signal , which prevents cell death of monocytes and foam cells [ 52 ] .
The same group demonstrated just recently that mast cells actively participate in the formation of aortic aneurysms by release of IL-6 and IFN ? , which induced apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and protease expression [ 111 ] .
Several receptor tyrosine kinases exhibit stimulated activity upon peroxynitrite exposure , triggering downstream phosphotyrosine @-@ dependent signalling , as shown for the platelet @-@ derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) and the receptor for brain @-@ derived neurotrophic factor ( TrkB ) in murine fibroblasts ( 24,25 ) , as well as the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) in rat lung myofibroblasts ( 26 ) .
Peroxynitrite @-@ mediated JNK activation has been associated with apoptotic cell death in murine alveolar C10 cells , in which JNK was activated upon the oxidation of the death receptor Fas .
Nomiyama et al , who reported that peroxynitrite inhibited insulin @-@ stimulated glucose uptake in preadipocyte @-@ derived 3T3 @-@ L1 cells by reducing insulin receptor substrate-1 ( IRS-1 ) protein levels and associated PI3K activity , upstream of Akt @/@ PKB ( 122 ) .
Administration of PTEN @-@ specific siRNA reversed PKB @/@ Akt inhibition and mitigated apoptosis in diabetic mouse aortas . These findings therefore suggest that hyperglycaemia may promote apoptosis in endothelial cells through PKB @/@ Akt downregulation , via a peroxynitrite @-@ mediated , LKB1 @-@ dependent PTEN activation ( 46 ) .
activation of ERK depended on EGFR , Src tyrosine kinase and calcium calmodulin in PC12 cells ( 31 ) , while requiring ras @/@ Raf-1 @/@ MEK activation in human neutrophils ( 58 ) .
we reported in H9C2 cardiomyocytes that peroxynitritemediated activation of ERK , although dependent on Raf-1 and MEK , was not due to upstream activation of p21 ras ( 63 ) .
we found that IL6 effectively inhibited LIF signalling , repressing transcription of the LIF receptor gp190 , and strongly inducing axotrophin @/@ MARCH-7 , a novel E3 ubitquitin ligase that we discovered to be active in degradation of gp190 protein .
Unlike IL6 , LIF supported expression of Foxp3 , the Treg lineage transcription factor , and LIF opposed IL6 by suppressing IL-6 @-@ induced IL-17A protein release .
Macrophages from PC Tg mice can express high level of human PON2 besides intrinsic mouse PON2 and PON3 ... PC Tg macrophages maintained significantly lower levels of ROS for at least 2 hours than macrophages from Wt mice ... Inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 are expressed at lower levels in PC Tg MPMs compared with Wt MPMs .
ATP @-@ mediated ADAM17 activation was also suppressed by the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 and , to a lesser extent , by preincubation with ? -@ EGFR antibody ( Fig. 6B ) , indicating a role for EGFR in ADAM17 activation .
addition of AG1478 also suppressed ATP @-@ mediated phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and I @- ? B ? ( Fig. 4A ) , indicating the involvement of EGFR activation in these signaling events .
As shown in Fig. 6A , both ATP and ? -@ ASGM1 indeed resulted in enhanced ADAM17 activity , measured by increased cleavage of a fluorogenic ADAM17 substrate , and this was attenuated after siRNA silencing of DUOX1 ( Fig. 6A
Silencing of DUOX1 attenuated the ATP @- and ? -@ ASGM1 @-@ induced TGF @- ? production observed in the presence of EGFR mAb ( Fig. 5B ) , indicating the involvement of DUOX1 activation in ATP @-@ induced TGF @- ? production and EGFR activation .
As shown in Fig. 1A , the HO-1 level in Bach1 -/- mouse lungs was significantly higher than that of WT mice even before hyperoxic exposure , and the time @-@ dependent increase in HO-1 expression in Bach1 -/- mouse lungs was much greater than that ofWT mice during hyperoxic exposure .
unexpectedly , however , the levels of IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid from Bach1 ( -/- ) mice were significantly higher than those of WT mice . ..... In addition , a chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the binding of Bach1 to the IL-6 promoter and its detachment after oxidative stress .
Inhibition of COX2 markedly reduced both IL-1 beta and IL-6 release .
The addition of IL-1b ( 100 pg @/@ ml ) alone significantly increased the levels of IL-6 , and approximately to the same level as 160 lg @/@ cm2 silica .
In TNBS colitis , no differences were found in interleukin ( IL ) - 18 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - alpha expression between IRF4 knockout and wild-type mice . However , significant differences were detected in IL-6 and IL-17 production .
More importantly , persistent activation of IL-6 downstream Stat3 in AT II epithelial cellsdirec tly induced lung inflammation and bronchioalveolar adenocarcinoma ( 22 ) .
As shown in Fig. 3A , there was a steady increase of BrdUrd pulse @-@ labeled AT II epithelial cells in the doxycycline @-@ treated bitransgenic mice compared with untreated littermates . The increase of MMP12 @-@ induced cell proliferation wastime dependent .
MMP12 overexpression in lung epithelial cells , bitransgenic mice were treated with doxycycline for various time lengths . Histopathologic analyses revealed lung abnormalities in bitransgenic mice beginning at 6 weeks of doxycycline treatment . At this stage , marked inflammatory cell infiltration and emphysema were readily detectable ( Fig. 2A , +Dox 6W ) .
FACS analysis showed a more than 5 @-@ fold decrease of Annexin V @–@ labeled AT II epithelial cellsin 9 @-@ month doxycyclinetreated bitransgenic mice compared with untreated littermates ( 21.41 % versus 4.91 % ) .
Bronchioalveolar adenocarcinomas were observed in the lungs of bitransgenic mice after doxycycline treatment asearly as16 weeks ( Fig. 2A , +Dox 16W ) .
After 10 to 15 weeksof doxycycline treatment , the bitransgenic mice began to develop adenomatoid hyperplasia in both parenchyma and small conducting airways ( F ig . 2A , +Dox 10W ) , which resembles to the histopathologic feature of dysplasia in clinical lesions .
In addition , Stat3 @-@ induced downstream developmental gene HNF4a wasup @-@ regulated to 78.6 @-@ fold , Foxa3 to 9.3 @-@ fold , and SHH to 3.3 @-@ fold ( Fig. 4D ) .
As shown in Fig. 4A , IL-6 concentration in BALF of doxycycline @-@ treated mice was steadily increased compared with those in untreated bitransgenic mice in a time @-@ dependent fashion ,
increased expression of several other MMPs was also observed in doxycycline @-@ treated bitransgenic mice compared with untreated mice . ( Fig 4D )
In this study , we found disorganized actin in the form of membrane ruffling and enhanced cell migration in LRP1 @-@ deficient ( LRP1 -/- ) SMCs .
Because PDGFRb activation , through transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain , triggers a cascade of phosphorylation events which eventually lead to the activation of extracellular regulated @-@ protein kinases ( Erks ) , phosphorylated @- Erk1 @/@ Erk2 was used as an indicator of PDGFRb activation [ 7 ] .
An approximately 2.5 @-@ fold increase of Smad2 phosphorylation at Ser 465 @/@ 467 was also detected in LDLR expressing , LRP1 @-@ deficient SMCs ( Figure 6B , C ) .
About a two @-@ fold increase of PDGFRb expression was detected in smLRP1 -/- mice regardless of LDLR genotype ( Figure 2A , C ) . Increased Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation was also observed in these aortas ( Figure 2A ) . These data suggest that the expression and activation of PDGFRb is only regulated by LRP1 , not LDLR .
Studies from our laboratory have shown that LRP1 suppresses PDGF receptor b ( PDGFRb ) activation and protects against atherosclerosis .
Cebpb expression is therefore required in infiltrating macrophages for upregulation of M2 @-@ specific genes
deletion of two CREB @-@ binding sites from the Cebpb promoter abrogates Cebpb induction upon macrophage activation . This blocks the downstream induction of M2 @-@ specific Msr1 , Il10 , II13 ra , and Arg-1 genes , whereas the inflammatory ( M1 ) genes Il1 , Il6 , Tnfa , and Il12 are not affected
Studies using TLR-4 -/- mice have demonstrated that induction of MCP-1 in BAL fluid upon exposure of mice to subacute ( exposed for a period of 5 weeks ) levels of CS depends on the presence of wild-type TLR-4 , whereas TLR-4 plays a minor role in MCP-1 induction in the presence of chronic smoke exposure ( 26 weeks ) [ 45 ] .
LPS stimulated pulmonary neutrophil recruitment , NF-kB promoter activity , and TNF-a secretion are found to be severely impaired in GM @-@ CSF -/- mice .
IL-1b increased the production of neutrophil chemoattractants such as Gro-alpha ( CXCL1 ) and MIP-2 ( CXCL2 ) in lungs .
Tollip has been shown to associate directly with TLR-4 and inhibit TLR-4 @-@ mediated activation of NF @- kB luciferase reporter vectors in a mouse macrophage cell line ( RAW @-@ 264.7 ) .
Treatment of sputum cells from COPD patients with acetylcholine produced increased amounts of LTB4 , which was sensitive both to treatment with a muscarinic receptor antagonist and to the inhibition of ERK @- 1 @/@ 2 phosphorylation . This increased LTB4 synthesis also directly correlated with increased neutrophil chemotaxis .
IRAK-1 activation and recruitment is essential for activation of TRAF6 ( TNF @-@ associated factor 6 ) , which is an essential adaptor for MyD88 @-@ dependent NF-kB activation .
It has also been shown that IL-1b stimulates the release and activity of MMP-9 ( matrix metalloproteinase-9 ) from AM obtained from COPD smokers , which is significantly higher in comparison with those obtained from healthy smokers and non @-@ smokers [ 155 ] .
Similarly , preincubation with F ( ab ' ) 2 fragments of a monoclonal anti @-@ human IL-8 antibody inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis to CB sputum supernatants by 75 % [ 30 ] .
Including adenosine with IFN-gamma treatment delayed any measureable increase in STAT1 activation by > 60 min , and led to significantly reduced STAT1 activity at 60 , 120 , and 240 min post @-@ stimulation compared with cells treated with IFN-gamma alone ( p < 0.05 ; Fig. 4 ) .
Pretreatment with CCPA ( A1 receptor agonist ) , NECA ( non @-@ specific A1 and A2 receptor agonist ) , and CGS21680 ( A2A receptor agonist ) all resulted in a 14 @- to 15 @-@ fold increase in STAT1 activity over control cells , levels comparable to what was observed in cells treated with IFN-gamma alone ( Fig. 6 , A ? C )
As expected , we found that IFN-gamma led to a rapid rise in both JAK1 and JAK2 phosphorylation band density above baseline levels , and this IFN-gamma @-@ induced JAK activation was not altered by adenosine treatment at any time point ( data not shown ) .
Mechanistically , endothelial a6-integrin deficiency elevated significantly VEGF @-@ mediated angiogenesis both in vivo and ex vivo .
In particular , a6-integrin @-@ deficient endothelial cells displayed increased levels of VEGF @-@ receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) and VEGF @-@ mediated downstream ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation .
Blood vessels associated with IDC showed a significant reduction in mean a6-integrin pixel intensity when compared with blood vessels from normal breast tissue ( **p < 0.0001 , Figure 1b ) .
The results showed that there was a significant increase in tumour blood vessel density in a6 fl @/@ fl @-@ Tie1Cre+ mice compared with a6 fl @/@ fl @-@ Tie1Cre @- controls ( *@ p < 0.02 , Figure 3b ) .
As predicted , the absence of a6-integrin reduced the ability of the a6 -/— cells to adhere and migrate to Lm but did not affect the ability of these cells to adhere or migrate on Fn , Col or Vn ( *@ p < 0.05 , Figures 5c and 5d ) .
Western blot analysis revealed that VEGF stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in both a6 fl @/@ fl @-@ Tie1Cre @-@ and a6 fl @/@ fl @-@ Tie1Cre+ endothelial cells and that the levels of phosphorylated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( pERK1 @/@ pERK2 ) detected in a6 fl @/@ fl @-@ Cre+ endothelial cells after a VEGF stimulus were dramatically higher than those detected in a6 fl @/@ flTie1Cre @- endothelial cells ( Figure 6b ) .
Furthermore , blockade of VEGFR2 using the function blocking monoclonal antibody to VEGFR2 , DC101 [ 26 ] , ablated these enhanced VEGF @-@ mediated responses , demonstrating that the enhanced ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation was via VEGFR2 ( Figure 6b ) .
The mouse tumors mimic molecular hallmarks of their human tumor counterparts , including elevated IL-6 @/@ Stat3 @/@ Bcl-X ( L ) signaling . The newly developed mouse strains may provide a good preclinical research tool for the design and testing of new approaches to target IL-6 in treatment and prevention of human PCNs .
In contrast to TGFbeta1 @/@ IL-6 , IL-23 was critical for the induction of IL-22 in CD4+ T cells from both naive and CII @-@ immunized DBA @/@ 1 mice .
: In CD4+ T cells from naive DBA @/@ 1 mice , IL-23 alone hardly induced retinoic acid @-@ related orphan receptor gammat ( RORgammat ) , Th17 polarization , and Th17 cytokines , but it inhibited T-bet expression .
However , in CD4+ T cells from naive mice , IL-23 significantly increased the TGFbeta1 @/@ IL-6 @-@ induced Th17 polarization , including elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F and decreased expression of T-bet and FoxP3 . Of note , the IL-23 @-@ induced increase in IL-17A and IL-17F levels was prevented in T-bet @-@ deficient mice .
However , on stimulation with R848 or CpG DNA , B cells from both young and old Irf5 -/- mice produced lower levels of IL-6 than the B cells from C57BL @/@ 6 mice .
There was also a decrease in IRF-4 expression in Irf5 -/- B cells , seen both on RNA and protein levels ( Fig. 4 A and B ) .
Analysis of the expression of these factors by semiquantitative RT-PCR shows that purified B cells from both young and old Irf5 -/- mice exhibit significantly lower levels of Blimp-1 mRNA than B cells from the age @-@ matched C57BL @/@ 6 mice ( Fig. 4A ) .
we found that IL-33R signaling induced a time @-@ dependent activation of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 , protein kinase B ( PKB ) , JNK1 @/@ JNK2 , NF-kB , and p38 , and degradation of IkB ( supplemental Figure 1B ) .
Y721-c-Kit is autophosphorylated in response to stem cell factor ( SCF ) .
The supernatants from cultured LN cells were also collected and the production of various cytokines ( TNF-alpha , IFN-gamma , IL-6 , and IL-17 ) was measured ( Fig. 3B ) . The cytokine levels in BLT1 -/- cells were significantly lower than those in BLT1 +/+ cells

Leptin @-@ induced MUC5B expression was blocked by the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and p38 pathway inhibitors , but not by the JAK2 @/@ STAT3 pathway inhibitor .
Both IL-6 and G-CSF treatment did not markedly change surface IL @-@ 4Ra amounts on BM cells ; moreover , IL-6 had a detrimental effect on cell viability , thereby preventing any further functional characterization .
Despite the increased IL @-@ 4Ra expression following G-CSF treatment , this cytokine did not induce any appreciable imunosuppressive function in BM cells .
GM @-@ CSF induced a significant increase ( p = 0.028 versus untreated BM ) of IL @-@ 4Ra expression , and BM cells cultured with this cytokine inhibited CTL activity in a dose @-@ dependent fashion ( Figures 1A and 1B ) .
When we analyzed the percentage of the different subsets of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells , percentages of CD11 bhiGr-1 hi and CD11 bhiGr-1 @- cells were decreased in both C @/@ EBPp @-@ deficient strains , but subsets characterized by low and intermediate expression of the Gr-1 marker were significantly decreased only in fully ablated mice ( Figure 3D ) .
Following separation of CD11b+ cells from MCA203 tumor infiltrate , we found that loss of C @/@ EBPp caused a significant reduction in both arginase 1 ( Arg1 ) and nitric oxide synthase 2 ( Nos2 ) proteins ( Figure 6A ) , two enzymes that were described as crucial components of MDSC inhibitory machinery ( Bronte and Zanovello , 2005 ; Gabrilovich and Nagaraj , 2009 ) .
Cytokines were able to upregulate IL @-@ 4Ra expression , but a more pronounced effect was obtained by G-CSF+GM @-@ CSF combination ( Figure 7B and Figure S6B ) .
These results indicate that the endogenous IL-33 @/@ ST2 signaling pathway enhances the expression of CCR3 on eosinophils .
IL-33 triggered the production of IL-13 and IL-6 and strongly increased the production of CCL17 and TGF-b from WT eosinophils , but not ST2 -/- eosinophils , in a dosedependent manner ( Fig. 5A ) .
Pharmacological intervention with a VEGFR-2 @-@ neutralizing Ab ( anti @-@ Flk1 mAb ) abolished the production of IL-6 ( but not IL-12p70 ) and the subsequent development of allergen @-@ specific Th17 cell response .
In vivo production of VEGF and Th1 @- and Th17 @-@ polarizing cytokines ( IL-12p70 and IL-6 , respectively ) were upregulated by airway exposure to LPS .
Both Fyn and Hck phosphorylate the adaptor protein Gab2 to activate PI3K signaling and promote microtubule formation that is important for granule translocation to the plasma membrane ( 9 , 11 ) .
PTP ? is required for SCF @-@ induced c-Kit and Fyn activation , and in this way regulates a Fyn @-@ based c-Kit signaling axis ( Fyn @/@ Gab2 @/@ Shp2 @/@ Vav @/@ PAK @/@ Rac @/@ JNK ) that mediates mast cell migration .
Furthermore , we find that basal arginase 1 expression and associated arginase activity is markedly increased in MKP-2 deletion mice , a response which would also mediate a reduction in NO formation , this is again different to the findings in MKP-1 ?/? macrophages .
MKP-2 negatively regulated IL-12 , IL-6 and TNF-a expression and positively regulates IL-10 confirming this hypothesis .
pDCs were found to rapidly infiltrate both murine and human skin wounds and to transiently produce type I IFNs via TLR7 @- and TLR9 @-@ dependent recognition of nucleic acids .
Like pDC @-@ depleted mice , IFN-alpha @/@ beta receptor @-@ deficient mice showed a significant delay in wound reepithelization ( Fig. 5 E ) and displayed a profound deficiency in IL-6 , IL-17 , and IL-22 expression levels in injured skin , without affecting the expression of IFN-gamma ( Fig. 5 F ) .
Expression of both IFN-a2 and IFN-b mRNA was found to be profoundly abrogated in TLR7 @-@ deficient mice
In the present study , we found that when RSK4 is inhibited in vitro using short hairpin RNA technology , cells can bypass stress @-@ induced senescence and oncogene @-@ induced senescence : normal human fibroblasts grew following oxidative stress , induction of DNA damage and KRAS ( V12 ) or BRAF ( E600 ) overexpression .
Two days after BRAFE600 selection , we seeded cells at low density and performed growth curves . RSK4 inhibition partially rescued BRAFE600 @-@ induced senescence in both TIG3 and TIG3 p16 @-@ null ( Figure 4A ) .
This IFNg @-@ stimulated expression of T-bet is dependent on signaling through JAK2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) and activates T-bet @-@ dependent DNA binding activity
In the lung , the concentration of IL-6 was increased , which aberrantly activated oncogenic Stat3 and increased expression of Stat3 downstream genes in epithelial tumor progenitor cells .
Spontaneous emphysema and lung adenocarcinoma were sequentially developed after MMP12 overexpression .
MMP12 suppresses T-cell proliferation and function in vivo The CD4+ T-lymphocyte population was significantly decreased in the spleen of doxycycline @-@ treated bitransgenic mice ( 5.58 % ) compared with that in untreated ones ( 21.14 % ) , while the CD8+ T-lymphocyte population was less affected ( Figure 2A ) .
The culture medium showed decreased secretion of IL-2 , IL-4 , and IFN7 in the activated MMP12 @-@ treated samples ( Figure 2F ) .
CD11b+ @/@ Gr-1+ cells from doxcycline @-@ treated bitransgenic mice showed the strongest inhibition on proliferation of wild-type CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3C ) .
This inhibition was further confirmed by a significant reduction of IL-2 and IL-4 secretion , implicating a functional impairment of CD4+ T cells by CD11b+ @/@ Gr-1+ cells from doxcycline @-@ treated bitransgenic mice ( Figure 3D ) .
Compared with doxycycline @-@ untreated bitransgenic mice , the expression levels of IL-1p , IL-6 , MIP-2 , and TNF-a were abnormally increased in the plasma of doxycycline @-@ treated bitransgenic mice ( Figure 4A ) .
To determine if the ERK @-@ MAPK pathway was also activated by TLR2 in megakaryocytes , lysates of Meg-01 cells were treated with 1 ? g @/@ mL Pam3CSK4 for up to 1 hour and were immunoblotted for phosphorylated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 . As shown in Figure 1A , there was an increase in the phosphorylation of ERK beginning at 5 minutes that peaks at 30 minutes ( 105.8 % ± 3.9 ) .
GP1b is part of the GPIb @-@ IX-V complex that binds vWF and thrombin . Its expression level was significantly increased by 162 % and cell surface expression , as determined by flow cytometry , was also increased by 114 % with Pam3CSK4 treatment ( Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure 4C ) .
CD41 , also known as integrin ? IIb , part of the ? IIb ? III receptor that binds fibrinogen , was also significantly increased in the presence of Pam3CSK4 by 123 % ( Figure 5B ) . Surface expression of CD41 was increased by 125 % as shown by flow cytometry ( Supplemental Figure 4D ) .
Unexpectedly , TGF-beta treatment also induced increased IL-6 production by pDC .
Api6 overexpression in lung epithelial cells only caused regional inflammation , not systemic inflammation .
At the gene transcriptional level , Api6 overexpression stimulated mRNA expression of Stat3 and its upstream stimuli IL-6 in whole lung cells , AT II epithelial cells , and alveolar macrophages ( Fig. 4A ) .
Significant reductions in brain levels of early cytokines , including IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA expression , and late cytokine high mobility group box-1 protein ( HMGB1 ) , were found in the gelsolin @-@ treated group compared to the placebo group at all time points ( Figure 4 ) .
Factors from murine pancreatic cancer cells cause the down-regulation of SHIP-1 expression , which may potentially contribute to MDSC expansion , and the suppression of CD8+ T cell immune responses .
qRT @-@ PCR and Western blot analyses revealed the in vivo down-regulation of SHIP-1 expression in splenocytes from TB mice .
Western blot analyses also detected reduced SHIP-1 activity , increased AKT-1 and BAD hyper @-@ phosphorylation and up-regulation of BCL-2 expression in splenocytes from TB mice .
In vitro , qRT @-@ PCR and Western blot analyses detected reduced SHIP-1 mRNA and protein expression in control splenocytes co-cultured with Panc 02.03 cells .
Results from the Inflammatory Cytometric Bead Analysis ( CBA ) Kit detected pro @-@ inflammatory factors Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) to a greater extent than Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) , Interferon gamma ( IFN-y and Interleukin-12p 70 ( IL-12p70 ) in the supernatants of cultured murine Panc 02.03 cells ( Figure 1a ) .
TB splenocytes have a reduction in SHIP-1 expression .
Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ( qRT @-@ PCR ) results detected a decrease in SHIP-1 mRNA expression in TB compared to control splenocytes ( Figure 3b ) .
TB splenocytes have reduced SHIP-1 activity .
Western blot analyses did not detect phosphorylation of tyrosine 1020 on SHIP-1 , in splenocytes from TB compared to control mice ( Figure 4a ) .
TB splenocytes have increased AKT activity .
Western Blot results revealed hyper @-@ phosphorylation of AKT-1 at Ser473 in whole splenocytes from TB compared to control mice ( Figure 4b ) .
TB splenocytes have increased BCL-2 expression .
Western Blot results showed hyperphosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 in splenocytes from TB mice compared to control mice ( Figure 4c ) .
Western blot results revealed an up-regulation in BCL-2 expression in splenocytes from TB mice ( Figure 4d ) compared to control .
Murine Panc 02.03 cells down-regulate SHIP-1 expression in vitro .
qRT @-@ PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in SHIP-1 mRNA expression in control splenocytes co-cultured with Panc 02.03 cells compared to control splenocytes cultured alone ( Figure 5a ) .
In addition , western blot results revealed greater than a a 2 @-@ fold reduction in SHIP-1 protein expression in control splenocytes cocultured with Panc 02.03 cells compared to control splenocytes cultured alone ( Figure 5b ) .
These results correlate with our in vivo data and show that Panc 02.03 cells are able to suppress SHIP-1 mRNA and protein expression in vitro .
In WT mice CH induced an approximate 2 @-@ fold increase in IL-6 mRNA at three weeks that was abrogated in C3 -/- mice ... We observed increases in lung intracellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) ... the increase in ICAM-1 was abrogated in C3 -/- mice ( Fig. 7 ) .
This Raf-1 @-@ mediated fine tuning of Rok-a signaling allows the activation of junctional myosin and the timely maturation of AJ essential for maintaining cell cohesion during sprouting angiogenesis
In TLR2 agonist , heat @-@ killed Listeria monocytogenes @-@ activated human monocytes , NA reduced secretion of TNF @- ? ( by 48.6 ± 7.1 % ) , interleukin-6 ( by 60.9 ± 1.6 % ) , and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( by 59.3 ± 5.3 % )
Cytokine determination within BAL fluid revealed that LPS challenged Tie2 @-@ adam17 -/- mice showed reduced release of IL-6 ( Fig 7A , 3.9 @-@ fold ) and TNF-a ( Fig 7B , 1.6 @-@ fold ) , whereas no effect was observed in PBS @-@ challenged mice .
. The concentration of IL-6 , IL-13 and IL-17 was significantly higher in KO mice relative to wild-type mice , while that of IL-12 was significantly higher in wild-type mice relative to KO mice .
the expression of tissue damage @-@ related proteins , TGF @- ? and mesothelin was more markedly increased in the lungs of KO mice relative to wild-type mice .
In this study , we identified microRNA-494 ( miR-494 ) , whose expression was dramatically induced by tumor @-@ derived factors , as an essential player in regulating the accumulation and activity of MDSCs by targeting of phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) and activation of the Akt pathway .
miR-494 is highly expressed in tumor @-@ expanded MDSCs .
As shown in Fig. 1C , significantly increased expression of miR-494 was detected in both subpopulations compared with their counterpart from tumor @-@ free mice ( granulocytic MDSCs , p < 0.01 ; monocytic MDSCs , p < 0.001 ) .
Tumor @-@ derived factors , especially TG'F @-@ fH , markedly induce the upregulation of miR-494 in MDSCs .
As expected , we found that miR-494 expression was significantly induced by TCCM in a dose @-@ dependent manner ( Fig. 2A ) .
As shown in Fig. 2B , we found that the expression of miR-494 in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells was not affected by GM @-@ CSF and IL-6 , but interestingly , miR-494 expression was significantly induced by TGF-b1 treatment ( p < 0.001 ) .
Moreover , the induction of miR-494 was partially blocked by anti @-@ TGF @-@ p1 mAb in cells stimulated with 4T1 TCCM ( Fig. 2C ) , and the upregulation of miR-494 was impaired in Smad 3 @-@ deficient Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells isolated from the spleen of Smad 3_/_ mice ( Fig. 2D ) .
As expected , the expression levels of ARG1 , MMP2 , MMP13 , and MMP14 were significantly upregulated in lv-494 @-@ infected MDSCs compared with those in lv @-@ ctrl @-@ infected MDSCs ( Fig. 4B ) ; moreover , lv @-@ sponge overtly blocked the induction in the expression of these molecules .
As shown in Fig. 4G , OT-1 CD8+ T cell proliferation was significantly suppressed by lv-494 @-@ infected MDSCs in comparison with lv @-@ ctrl @-@ infected MDSCs , and this suppressive activity could be partially blocked by an ARG1 inhibitor nor @-@ NOHA .
Notably , the PTEN protein level was significantly downregulated in tumor @-@ expanded MDSCs compared with that in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells from tumor @-@ free mice , whereas PTEN mRNA expression showed no difference ( Fig. 6A ) .
When the reporter plasmids with miR-494 mimics or the scrambled oligonucleotide were cotransfected to HEK-293 cells , we observed that the miR-494 mimics markedly decreased the luciferase activity ( Fig. 6B ) .
Furthermore , transfection of lv-494 significantly decreased PTEN expression in MDSCs , thus suggesting that endogenous PTEN is targeted and regulated by miR-494 ( Fig. 6C ) .. To confirm whether miR-494 @-@ induced activation of MDSCs was mediated by targeting of PTEN expression , we designed a lentiviral vector encoding 39 @-@ UTR @-@ depleted PTEN to enforce the expression of PTEN in MDSCs .
Overexpression of PTEN in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells did not affect the TDF @-@ induced miR-494 up-regulation , whereas the increased expression of MMPs induced by TCCM were significantly blocked ( Fig. 6D ) , and SDF-1 @/@ CXCL12 @-@ mediated MDSC migration was abrogated ( Fig. 6E ) .
Significantly reduced PTEN expression was also detected in Gr-1+ CD11b+ cells after TCCM stimulation ( Fig. 6G ) ; this was inversely correlated with the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and NF-kB .
As shown in Fig. 6H , the increased levels of MMPs induced by TCCM were completely abolished by LY294002 , suggesting that the Akt activity is indispensable for the activation of MDSCs .
BAY-117802 significantly blocked MMP13 expression but had a limited effect on the upregulation of MMP2 and MMP14 , whereas rapamycin eliminated the expression of all MMPs .
TGF @-@ p1 @-@ induced miR-494 was involved in the negative regulation of PTEN expression .
Transcriptional reprogramming of tumors via DmiR-580 , 588 or 190 over-expression resulted in downregulation of pro @-@ angiogenic factors such as TIMP-3 , bFGF and TGFalpha .
Figure 2D shows the high rate of proliferative Ki67+ cells in a representative dormant miR-588 expressing A-GBM tumor at day 113 post injection .
We found that antiangiogenic and dormancy promoting genes , Angiomotin ( AMOT-1 ) and Eph receptor A5 ( EphA5 ) , were both upregulated in all DmiR expressing A-GBM tumors as compared to the GFP @-@ vector @- control A-GBM cells ( Figure 4 ) .
In contrast , genes involved in pro @-@ angiogenic signaling , including tissue inhibitor of metalloprotei @-@ nases 3 ( TIMP-3 ) , hypoxia @-@ induced factor 1 alpha ( HIF-1-alpha ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF , FGF2 ) , and the K-ras tumor oncogene , were consistently downregulated in DmiR expressing A-GBM .
Importantly , we found Bv8 also known as prokineticin 2 ( Prok2 ) to be markedly downregulated in all three DmiR expressing A-GBM ( Figure 5A ) .
Over-expression of miR-580 , miR-588 and miR-190 in fast @-@ growing angiogenic glioblastoma .
In contrast , VEGF plugs in Pld1 ~ - ~ mice exhibited almost no vascularization ( Fig. 2 , A and B ) .
PLD1 deficiency reduced basal phosphorylation of Ser473 in Akt and prevented VEGF @-@ induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 ( Fig. 3 , C and D ) .
Pldl -- endothelial cells similarly exhibited a 50 % reduction in basal phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 but otherwise exhibited similar kinetics to wild-type cells for VEGF @-@ induced phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
Histological and quantitative analyses of the tumors revealed a 79 % decrease in microvessels in the tumors that formed in FIPI @-@ treated mice ( Fig. 4C ) .
Engagement of Gi @- and Gq @-@ protein @-@ coupled ETB receptors by ET-1 led to phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , p38 MAPK , and JNK1 @/@ JNK2 and then activated transcription factor NF @- ? B .
Engagement of Gi @- and Gq @-@ protein @-@ coupled ETB receptors by ET-1 led to phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , p38 MAPK , and JNK1 @/@ JNK2 and then activated transcription factor NF @- ? B .
Against this background , we conducted in vitro phosphorylation studies of the phosphorylation of in-tegrin avp3 dimer with activated ERK1 and found phosphorylation of the dimer ( Fig. 3A ) that was inhibited by the ERK inhibitor , FR180204 .
Integrin av bound to the COX-2 promoter in both OVCAR-3 and H522 cells in response to T4 ( Fig. 4A )
These results suggest that although T4 increased complex formation between integrin av and NCoR @/@ SMRT , the association between NCoR @/@ SMRT and DNA was unchanged .
The transcription of COX-2 , ERa , HIF @-@ la , and TR $ 1 was increased in thyroid hormone @-@ treated cells ( Fig. 4B ) .
Abundant autophagosomes in K-rasG12D/+;atg7 +/+ but not in K-rasG12D/+;atg7 -/- tumors were confirmed by electron microscopy ( Fig. 2B ) .
Reduction of atg7 @-@ deficient tumor burden was coincident with reduced proliferation ( Ki67 ) and decreased levels of phospho @-@ MEK1 @/@ MEK2 ( P-MEK1 @/@ P-MEK2 ) and P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 and p53 and p21 induction , compared with wild-type tumors ( Fig. 1I ; Supplemental Figs . S4A–C , S5A–C ) , suggesting that inhibition of tumor cell proliferation upon atg7 deletion is the main cause of reduced tumor burden .
atg7 deficiency in tumors prevented LC3-I processing to LC3 @-@ II and caused accumulation of LC3-I and autophagy substrate p62 in large aggregates apparent at 6 wk that increased throughout tumorigenesis
e ALDH1 activity in human PC ( N = 11 ) ; representative flow cytometry plot of human PC tumor gated on live EpCAM+ cells using Aldefluor assay .
Furthermore , GCSFR -/- mice exhibit a shift in the immune profile of PC tumors from a TH-2 to TH-1 immune response , characterized by increased expression of IFN-y , TNF-a and IL-12 with decreased expression of arginase-1 , IL-6 , TGF-P , IL-10 compared to WT mice ( Fig. 2d ) .
These monocytes acquired a Mo @-@ MDSC phenotype characterized by a significantly decreased expression of HLA @-@ DR and increased expression of arginase-1 as well as the ability to suppress CD8+ T cell proliferation in vitro [ 29 @-@ 32 ] ( Fig. 4a-c ) .
While we found that IL-6 mRNA gene expression was significantly downregulated by STAT3 inhibition ( Supplementary figure 11 ) , IL-6 blockade using anti @-@ IL-6 antibodies decreased but did not fully reverse the effect of Mo @-@ MDSC on increasing the prevalence of ALDH1Bright CSCs .
the 2 cytokines most intensively involved in eliciting the acute phase response are IL6 and IL1
alpha 2-macroglobulin , alpha 1-antichymotrypsin ( = contrapsin ) , cysteine protease inhibitor ( = thiostatin ) , alpha 1-antitrypsin , ceruloplasmin and fibrinogens are predominantly regulated by the keratinocyte @-@ derived HSF @-@ III/-II or IL-6
The mRNA expression of Foxp3 and RORyt in the spleen was very low in the normal control group but significantly higher in the model control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
SOCS3 protein expression was significantly downregulated in all groups except for the normal control group ( P < 0.05 ) .
Jak2 and STAT3 protein expression was significantly higher in the model control group than in all other groups ( P < 0.05 ) .
Blocking STAT3 activation with the small molecule inhibitor JSI-124 significantly inhibited the accumulation of NIK and IDO expression in MDSCs .
Knockdown of NIK in MDSCs suppressed IDO expression but not STAT3 activation .
RelB @-@ p52 dimers were found to directly bind to the IDO promoter , leading to IDO expression in MDSCs .
STAT3 activation @-@ induced IDO expression is independent of direct binding of STAT3 to the promoter region of IDO gene .
Blocking STAT3 activation by JSI-124 dramatically decreased the levels of p52 and RelB in nuclei ( Fig. 2C , p < 0.05 ) .
The level of STAT3 phosphorylation in MDSCs was reduced at 30 min and completely suppressed at 4 h after treatment with JSI-124 .
Consistently , the level of NIK in MDSCs started to decline at 1 h and was completely blocked at 8 h after JSI-124 treatment .
The level of IDO significantly decreased at 4 h after JSI-124 treatment ( Fig. 3A ) .
In NIK knockdown MDSCs , the level of IDO protein was reduced significantly , but the level of pSTAT3 protein was not affected ( Fig. 3B , 3C ) .
In contrast , both IDO and NIK expression were reduced by JSI-124 treatment in MDSCs ( Fig. 3A ) .
RelB @/@ p52 dimers directly bind to the IDO promoter to regulate IDO expression in MDSCs .
We isolated CD11b+ MDSCs from the spleen of JSI-124 @-@ treated mice and found decreased expression of p-STAT3 , NIK , and IDO protein in CD11b+ MDSCs compared with those isolated from the controls ( Fig. 6D ) .
Furthermore , a specific IL-6 @-@ neutralizing Ab significantly decreased the levels of p-STAT3 , NIK , and IDO in MDSCs ( Fig. 7E , p < 0.05 ) .
Mitogen @-@ activated protein ( MAP ) kinase is central to a signal transduction pathway that triggers cell proliferation or differentiation . Activation of the p42 mapk isoform requires its phosphorylation at two residues , Thr 183 and Tyr 185 , and this phosphorylation is catalysed by MAP kinase kinase ( MAPKK ) .
Stable transfection of activated Ha-ras into a number of murine cells correlated with a down-regulation of the expression of the NF1 genes NF1 @/@ CTF and NF1 @/@ X .
The level of the DNA binding activity of the NF1 proteins was also reduced in Ha-v-ras @-@ transformed cells , and the expression of a gene that depends on this family of transcription factors was specifically repressed .
MEK1 and MEK2 can also be activated by autophosphorylation . Autophosphorylation of MEKs correlates with their ability to phosphorylate and activate ERKs .
The two SAPK isoforms are 46 and 54 kDa . A 46 kDa kinase activity was induced in response to anisomycin but not in response to TPA .
In NIH3T3 cells , co-transfection of an expression vector for Gal @-@ Elk mediates expression from a transfected GAL @-@ CAT reporter gene , which , as shown in Figure 6a , b , is potentiated upon treatment of serum @-@ starved cells with anisomycin . Replacement of the major SAPK phosphorylation site in Gal @-@ Elk , Ser383 , with alanine ( Gal @-@ Elks 383 A ) abrogates induction of reporter gene expression .
Elk-1 is phosphorylated by both kinases ( MAPK8 and MAPK9 ) , each of which is strongly stimulated by pre @-@ treatment of cells with ultraviolet light .
Figure 3b shows that activated SAPKs isolated from cells stimulate the formation of a ternary complex by Elk-1 ( Fig. 3b , lanes 8 and 10 ) .
As shown in Figure 6e , expression of MEKK1 fails to activate either ERK1 or ERK2 , whereas both p46 SAPK and p54SAPK are activated at expression levels that result in reporter gene expression .
Co-transfection of 1.25 ug MEKK1 expression vector elicited a 24 @-@ fold activation of Gal @-@ Elk @-@ dependent reporter expression in serum @-@ starved NIH3T3 cells ( Fig. 6c , d ) .
The observation that Elk-1 is phosphorylated directly and activated by p46SAPK and p54SAPK further implicates it in the stress @-@ response induction of the c-fos gene .
For comparison , ElkC was also phosphorylated using recombinant ERK1 that had been activated by phosphorylation with a constitutively active mutant of the MAPK @/@ ERK kinase MKK1 [ 23 ] .
In the case of Th2 @-@ type cytokines , enhanced production of IL-4 and IL-6 was reduced by treatment with anti @-@ TGF- @/@ 3 or anti @-@ IL @- IO ( Fig. 5B ) .
As shown in Figure 5A , reduced production of Th I -@ type cytokines ( IFN-y , not detected ; IL-2 , 38.0 -@ t 10.0 % ) by EL4-T was significantly rcstored by treatmcnt with anti @-@ TGF-P ( IFN-y , 191.0 i 21.9 % ; IL-2 , 8 I . 1 i 17.5 % ) , while anti @-@ IL @- IO treatment had little etfect
Similar observation that immunoprecipitated B-Raf from EGF @-@ stimulated Swiss3T3 cells could activate both MEK1 and MEK2 was also obtained ( data not shown ) .
The activated GST @-@ MEK1 was then used to activate the purified recombinant extracellular signal @-@ regulated kinase 1 , whose activity was measured by the [ 32P-g ] ATP incorporation into MBP , an extracellular signal @-@ regulated kinase 1 substrate .
c-Raf activates MEK1 by phosphorylating at serine residues 218 and 222 ( 30 @–@ 32 ) .
activated MEK1 increased Elk-1 @- and c-Jun @-@ dependent gene expression but not ATF2 @-@ dependent gene expression ( Fig. 4 ) .
MKK3 ( Glu ) increased ATF2 @- and Elk-1 @-@ dependent reporter gene expression but caused only a small increase in Jun @-@ dependent gene expression ( Fig. 4 ) .
In contrast , the effect of MKK6 ( Glu ) was markedly reduced in experiments using phosphorylation @-@ defective ( Ala-69 , Ala-71 ) ATF2 .
Increased ATF2 @-@ dependent gene expression was observed in cells transfected with MKK6 ( Glu ) . In contrast , MKK3 ( Glu ) did not increase ATF2 @-@ dependent gene expression in the absence of overexpression of p38 MAP kinase ( Fig. 8A ) .
Specifically , PTH and PTHrP rapidly and transiently induce expression of the mRNAs encoding IL-6 and LIF .
endogenous GMF is rapidly phosphorylated upon stimulation of astrocytes by phorbol 12 @-@ myristate 13-acetate We further observed that protein kinase A ( PKA ) - phosphorylated GMF is a potent inhibitor ( IC50 = 3 nM ) of the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( p44 @/@ p42 ) subfamily of mitogen @-@ activated protein ( MAP ) kinase .
PKA @-@ phosphorylated GMF strongly enhances the activity of a related but distinct subfamily of MAP kinase , the p38 MAP kinase , showing an increase of 60 @-@ fold over baseline and an EC50 of 7 nM .
intracellular interaction of PKA , GMF , and p38 is supported by the phosphorylation of GMF upon cellular stimulation by forskolin ( blocked by PKA inhibitor ) and by the co-immunoprecipitation of p38 with GMF from cell lysates . Withdrawal of nerve growth factor from PC12 leads to increased GMF phosphorylation with a time course similar to that reported for p38 activation .
In addition , SHP-1 and its mutants showed similar association and dephosphorylation of the other Jak family members ( JAK1 , Tyk2 , and JAK3 ) but not c-fes when coexpressed in Cos-7 cells ( data not shown ) .
Hypoxia was capable of inducing VEGF mRNA in both immortalized and transformed endothelial cells ( 4.5 @-@ fold in cells expressing SV40 large T antigen alone or in combination with H-ras ) , but both baseline and induced VEGF mRNA expression was increased in cells containing activated ras ( Fig. 4 ) .
Treatment of cells with wortmannin , a steroidal inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( 15 ) , resulted in a decreased level of VEGF under hypoxic conditions but the fold stimulation of VEGF mRNA was not changed ( Fig. 5 ) .
Cells with activated ras demonstrated high level of expression of 72 @-@ kDa metalloproteinase ( MMP-2 , gelatinase A ) , and 92 @-@ kDa metalloproteinase ( MMP-9 , gelatinase B ) compared with cells containing SV40 large T antigen alone .
Treatment of ras @-@ containing cells with wortmannin resulted in a decrease in MMP expression ( Fig. 6 ) .
Since wortmannin inhibits VEGF and MMP activity , but does not restore TIMP activity , tumor @-@ igenesis is not expected to be fully suppressed .
Wortmannin could inhibit ras @-@ mediated induction of VEGF , but it did not inhibit the hypoxic regulation of VEGF .
This suggests that the hypoxic regulation of VEGF is independent of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase .
PITSLRE kinases are a superfamily of Cdc2 @-@ like kinases that have been implicated in apoptotic signaling and tumorigenesis . In this paper we report that tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - mediated apoptosis is associated with a CrmA @- and Bcl-2 @-@ inhibitable cleavage of PITSLRE kinases , indicating a role for CASPs .
Elevated levels of human TNF-alpha were accompanied by increases in synovial cell expression of murine IL-1 beta and IL-6
e show here that oncogenic forms of Ha-Ras activate NF-kappaB , not through induced nuclear translocation , but rather through the activation of the transcriptional function of the NF-kappaB RelA @/@ p65 subunit .
1 ) STAT proteins play an essential role in angiotensin II @-@ induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation , 2 ) JAK2 plays an essential role in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 , and 3 ) convergent mitogenic signaling cascades involving the cytosolic kinases JAK2 , MEK1 , and ERK1 mediate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation
The present study demonstrates that erythropoietin ( Epo ) and IL-3 induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the SH2 @/@ SH3 @-@ containing adapter protein CrkL and its transient association with tyrosine @-@ phosphorylated SHP-2 , Shc , and Cbl in a murine IL-3 @-@ dependent cell line , 32D , expressing the Epo receptor ( EpoR ) .
The hsp90 beta gene promoter contains binding sites for the transcription factors nuclear factor IL-6 ( \" NF-IL6 \" ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT-3 ) , which are activated respectively by the mitogen @-@ activated @-@ protein-kinase and Jak-kinase pathways following IL-6 treatment .
In contrast , IL-1 , which activates only the \" NF-IL6 \" pathway , synergizes with heat shock to produce strong activation of hsp90 .
formation of the hCAF-1 @/@ BTG1 complex is driven by phosphorylation at BTG1 ( Ser-159 ) and implicates this complex in the signalling events of cell division that lead to changes in cellular proliferation associated with cell @-@ cell contact .
in vitro the hCAF-1 @/@ BTG1 complex formation was dependent on the phosphorylation of a putative p34 cdc2 kinase site on BTG1 ( Ser-159 ) .
The human BTG1 protein is thought to be a potential tumour suppressor because its overexpression inhibits NIH 3T3 cell proliferation .
Pak3 phosphorylates Raf-1 on serine 338 in vitro and in vivo . The p21 @-@ activated protein kinases are regulated by the Rho @-@ family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 .
We next examined the mechanisms accounting for the increase in HER3 by MAPK pathway inhibitors in BRAF mutant thyroid cell lines .
Upregulation of HER3 has been found to mediate resistance to PI3K @/@ AKT ( 26 ) or HER2 ( 27 ) inhibitors in HER2 @-@ amplified breast cancer cell lines , which is caused in part through a FoxO3A @-@ dependent induction of HER3 gene transcription .
As shown in Fig. 5A , PLX4032 treatment increased HER3 and HER2 mRNAs in all six BRAF @-@ mutant thyroid cancer cell lines tested .
Similar results were found following treatment with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 ( not shown ) .
The effects of the MEK inhibitor on total HER2 , HER3 protein and on pHER3 were dose dependent , and inversely associated with the degree of inhibition of pERK ( Fig. 5B ) .
RAF or MEK inhibitors induced luciferase activity of a HER3 promoter construct spanning ~ 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site in 8505C cells .
Serial deletions identified a minimal HER3 promoter retaining transcriptional response to vemurafenib and AZD6244 , which was located between -@ 401 and -@ 42 bp ( Fig. 5C ) .
This region does not contain any predicted FoxO binding sites .
Moreover , PLX4032 led to an increase in phosphorylation of FoxO1 @/@ 3A between 4 – 10 h after addition of compound ( not shown ) , which is known to promote its dissociation from DNA , and likely discards involvement of these factors as transcriptional regulators of HER3 in response to MAPK pathway inhibition .
The minimal HER3 promoter region regulated by MAPK inhibitors overlaps with sequences previously described to be immunoprecipitated using antibodies against the ZFN217 transcription factor and CtBP1 @/@ CtBP2 corepressors ( 28 @–@ 30 ) .
CtBPs have also been described to negatively regulate transcriptional activity of the HER3 promoter in breast carcinoma cell lines ( 30 ) .
Silencing of CtBP1 , and to a lesser extent CtBP2 , increased basal HER3 in 8505C cells , and markedly potentiated the effects of PLX4032 ( Fig. 5D and 5E ) .
Knockdown of these factors modestly increased basal and PLX4032 - induced HER2 levels , which likely contributes to the remarkable increase in pHER3 we observed ( Fig. 5D and 5E ) .
Finally , CtBP1 and CtBP2 chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed decreased binding to the HER3 promoter after treatment with PLX4032 ( Fig. 5F ) .
These findings were confirmed in a second cell line ( Supplementary Fig. S5A ) .
Activation of Raf occurs via a complex , yet incompletely understood mechanism requiring membrane translocation , regulatory phosphorylation @/@ dephosphorylation events and , crucially , allosteric activation in the context of a side @-@ to @-@ side dimer comprising two Raf molecules or a Raf and a Ksr molecule .
Of the three Raf kinases , only B-Raf is able to function as an allosteric activator in the context of the Raf heterodimers , a role independent of B-Raf kinase activity .
The molecular basis for this has recently been elucidated by the Shaw lab , who has shown that the ability of acting as an activator depends on the presence of negative charges in the Raf N-terminal acidic motif .
In B-Raf , this motif is negatively charged due to the constitutive phosphorylation of Ser446 and @/@ or 447 , and to the presence of two aspartates at position 448 @/@ 9 ( Fig. 2A ) .
Allosteric activation by B-Raf induces cis @-@ autophosporylation in the activation loop of the receiver kinase , i.e. C-Raf , and renders it able to phosphorylate Mek .
Mek , in turn , phosphorylates the N-terminal acidic motif in C-Raf , converting it to an allosteric activator of other Rafs ( Fig. 2B and C ) .
This model explains why C-Raf mutants devoid of kinase activity can not function as activators , and why B-Raf can activate Mek directly as a homodimer .
Phosphorylated Ksr can also function as a transactivator ; however , since Raf binding to Ksr induces limited kinase activity , in quiescent cells the constitutive association of Ksr with B-Raf may serve to prevent C-Raf binding to B-Raf , safeguarding against undue activation of the pathway .
PSPs dephosphorylate phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues .
One of the most abundantly expressed PSPs , protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) , can regulate the Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk pathway both positively and negatively .
As a positive regulator , PP2A associates with C-Raf and Ksr1 and dephosphorylates negative regulatory sites on both proteins , allowing their recruitment to the membrane and leading to Mek and Erk activation .
A similar role in C-Raf activation has been described for the catalytic subunit of PP1C , which associates with C-Raf in Ras @- and growth factor - stimulated cells .
In addition to promoting C-Raf activation , PP2A is also able to dephosphorylate Erk - dependent sites on C-Raf .
Since the sites have been described alternatively as negative regulatory or activating , the significance of these dephosphorylation events for Raf activation is unclear .
As a negative regulator of the pathway , PP2A can dephosphorylate the adapter protein Shc , required downstream of some tyrosine kinase receptors for the activation of the Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk module ; and it can dephosphorylate Mek and Erk proteins , thus inhibiting the cascade directly .
A further negative regulator of the cascade , at the level of C-Raf , is Protein phosphatase 5 ( PP5 ) , which associates with C-Raf via its N-terminal tetratricopeptide ( TPR ) domain in growth factor stimulated cells .
This interaction leads to the activation of PP5 catalytic activity and to the selective dephosphorylation of the activating serine residue at position 338 , terminating the signal .
Following ligand binding , Sos is brought from the cytoplasm to the activated receptor in a phosphotyrosine - dependent manner through adapter proteins such as Grb2 .
Grb2 contains SH3 domains that are bound constitutively to a carboxy - terminal proline - rich region of Sos , and the Grb2 ' 96 Sos complex is recruited to activated receptors by interactions between the SH2 domain of Grb2 and phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor .
The guanine nucleotide @-@ binding switch in three dimensions .
Activation requires dissociation of protein - bound GDP , an intrinsically slow process that is accelerated by guanine nucleotide ' 96 exchange factors ( GEFs ) .
This switch - ON process involves the exchange of GDP for GTP , and is , at least in principle , reversible .
The switch - OFF process is entirely different and involves hydrolysis of GTP to GDP , the guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) reaction , which is basically irreversible .
It is also intrinsically very slow and thus has to be accelerated by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) .
The mechanism of GEF action involves a series of fast reaction steps , which lead from a binary protein - nucleotide complex via a trimeric GNBP - nucleotide - GEF complex to a binary nucleotide - free complex , which is stable in the absence of nucleotide .
This series of reactions is reversed by rebinding of nucleotide , predominantly GTP , because of its higher concentration in the cell .
In principle , these reactions are fast and fully reversible , so that the GEF merely acts as a catalyst to increase the rate at which equilibrium between the GDP @- and GTP - bound forms of the protein is reached .
Protein kinase A @-@ dependent phosphorylation of serine 43 within the regulatory domain of Raf-1 reciprocally potentiates its interaction with Rheb and decreases its interaction with H-Ras .
We show that wild-type B-RAF forms a complex with C-RAF in a RAS @-@ dependent manner , whereas the mutants bind independently of RAS .
Importantly , we show that wild-type B-RAF can also activate C-RAF .
The homologous site on B-Raf , S445 , is constitutively phosphorylated , accounting for the higher basal activity of B-Raf .
In addition , introduction of B-Raf enhances and sustains integrin @-@ mediated activation of ERK in wild-type primary fibroblasts
siRNA @-@ mediated depletion of B-Raf reduced cell proliferation by up to 65 % through the inhibition of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation , irrespective of the mutational status of B-Raf .
Following expression of BRAFV600E in melanocytes , the majority of cells became senescent ( Figure 1D and data not shown ) , consistent with previous studies ( Michaloglou et al. , 2005 )

Sasaki et al. , “ Ubiquitination of Ras enhances activation and facilitates binding to select downstream effectors ” ( PMC3437993 )
We utilized an unbiased mass spectrometry @-@ based approach to identify ubiquitination sites of Ras .
His @-@ tagged ubiquitin and Flag @-@ tagged K-Ras4B ( K-Ras hereafter ) were expressed in HEK293T cells at levels similar to endogenous K-Ras ( Fig. 1B ) and subjected to sequential affinity chromatography .
His @-@ ubiquitinated proteins were purified by Co2+ metal affinity chromatography in 8M urea denaturing conditions .
His @-@ ubiquitinated K-Ras was subsequently purified with anti @-@ Flag resin .
Following purification , mono @- and di @- ubiquitinated K-Ras appeared to be the major ubiquitination forms , which is consistent with the endogenous K-Ras ubiquitination pattern ( Fig. 1 , A and B ) .
H-Ras ubiquitination sites were also determined by the same approach .
Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic fragments from the bands migrating at the positions expected for mono @- and di @-@ ubiquitinated Ras revealed ubiquitination at Lys residues 104 and 147 of K-Ras , and Lys residues 117 , 147 and 170 for H-Ras ( fig. S1C ) .
The tryptic peptide with ubiquitination at Lys147 ( K147 ) was the most frequently observed peptide for both K-Ras and H-Ras , while Lys117 appeared as a secondary major ubiquitination site in H-Ras .
To examine the effect of ubiquitination on GTP loading , we purified wild-type K-Ras , oncogenic G12V-K-Ras mutant or the ubiquitinated subfraction of wild-type K-Ras from 32P-orthophosphate labeled cells and utilized thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) and high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) to assess the ratio of 32P-GTP to 32P-GDP that co @-@ purified with each form of K-Ras .
As expected based on previous studies , wild-type K-Ras bound primarily 32P-GDP , while G12V @-@ Ras bound 32P-GTP ( Fig. 2 , A and B ) .
Interestingly , the ubiquitinated subfraction of wild-type K-Ras retained a significant amount of 32P-GTP .
These results are consistent with a model in which ubiquitination of Lys147 ( or Lys117 ) , destabilizes GDP binding , allowing spontaneous GDP @/@ GTP exchange .
It could be argued that GTP loading occurs prior to ubiquitination and that the GTP bound form of K-Ras , via interaction with effectors , is preferentially mono @-@ ubiquitinated via a feedback mechanism .
While it is difficult to eliminate this possibility , it is unlikely since , as shown in fig. S1B , the T35 mutant of K-Ras , which fails to interact with downstream effectors ( fig. S1B ) undergoes comparable monobuiquitination to wild type Ras .
These results , along with the crystal structure , support a model in which mono @-@ ubiquitination at a Lys residue directly involved in GDP binding either enhances nucleotide exchange on K-Ras , impairs GTP hydrolysis , or both .
To corroborate this finding , we measure the activity of Ras by the GST @-@ RBD pull-down assay .
To ensure that ubiquitinated Ras was being detected , the protein pulled down by GST @-@ RBD was subjected to a second affinity purification on a cobalt column to purify the Flag @-@ His @-@ tagged K-Ras .
As predicted , only a very small fraction of wild-type K-Ras was pulled down by the GST @-@ RBD ( Fig. 2C and fig. S1D ) , consistent with very little wild-type K-Ras being in the GTP state under these conditions ( Fig. 2 , A and B ) .
However , a much greater fraction of the ubiquitinated @-@ K-Ras was pulled down by the GST @-@ RBD ( Fig. 2C and fig. S1D ) .
These results are consistent with a greater fraction of ubiquitinated K-Ras being in the GTP state ( Fig. 2 , A and B ) .
Turke et al. “ MEK inhibition leads to PI3K @/@ AKT activation by relieving a negative feedback on ERBB receptors ” ( PMC3515079 )
We hypothesized that the MEK @/@ ERK pathway may suppress trans @-@ phosphorylation of ERBB3 by directly phosphorylating the JM domains of EGFR and HER2 , and that this could be a dominant MEK inhibitor @-@ induced feedback leading to AKT activation in these cancers .
We used tandem mass spectrometry to measure the effects of AZD6244 on phosphorylation of this JM domain threonine residue in both EGFR @-@ mutant and HER2 @- amplified cancer models .
Targeting both the phosphorylated and non @-@ phosphorylated peptide forms , we detected a 66 % average decrease in EGFR T669 phosphorylation and a 75 % decrease in HER2 T677 phosphorylation upon treatment with AZD6244 ( Figure 5B , Supplemental Figure 8 ) .
Phospho @-@ specific antibodies confirmed that treatment with AZD6244 inhibited phosphorylation of T669 of EGFR and the analogous T677 of HER2 ( Figure 5A ) .
Together these data indicate that loss of this inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the JM domains of EGFR and HER2 occurs in cancer cell lines following MEK inhibition , presumably due to differential subcellular localization and @/@ or binding proteins .
Mutation of T669 and T677 abrogates MEK inhibitor @-@ induced suppression of ERBB3 Activation
We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity , which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the JM domains of EGFR and HER2 , thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation .
To test this hypothesis , we transiently transfected CHO @-@ KI cells , which do not express ERBB receptors endogenously , with wild-type ERBB3 with either wild-type EGFR or EGFR T669A .
In cells transfected with wild-type EGFR , MEK inhibition led to feedback activation of phospho @-@ ERBB3 and phosho @-@ EGFR , recapitulating the results we had observed in our panel of cancer cell lines ( Figure 6A ) .
In contrast , the EGFR T669A mutant increased both basal EGFR and ERBB3 tyrosine phosphorylation that was not augmented by MEK inhibition .
As a control , we treated CHO @-@ KI cells expressing EGFR T669A with HRG ligand to induce maximal ERBB3 phosphorylation ( Figure 6A ) , indicating that the lack of induction of phospho @-@ ERBB3 in EGFR T669A expressing cells following MEK inhibition was not simply due to the saturation of the system with phospho @-@ ERBB3 .
We observed analogous results in CHO @-@ KI cells expressing wild-type ERBB3 in combination with wild-type or T677A mutant HER2 ( Figure 6B ) .
Together these results support the hypothesis that inhibition of ERK @-@ mediated phosphorylation of a conserved JM domain threonine residue leads to feedback activation of EGFR , HER2 , and ERBB3 ( Figure 7 ) .
To determine if this feedback model explains the activation of PI3K signaling in EGFR @-@ mutant cancers , we used shRNA to knockdown endogenous EGFR ( which carries an exon 19 deletion ) in the HCC827 NSCLC cell line and replaced with either EGFR ( exon 19 del ) wild-type at T669 , or EGFR ( exon 19 del ) carrying a T669A mutation .
Of note , this is the same EGFR @-@ mutant cell line in which we observed that EGFR T669 is phosphorylated in MEK @-@ dependent manner ( Figure 5 , Supplemental Figure 8A ) .
When endogenous EGFR was replaced with EGFR ( exon19 del ) wild-type at T669 , MEK inhibition led to significant feedback activation of ERBB3 @/@ PI3K @/@ AKT signaling ( Figure 6C ) .
However , replacement with the EGFR ( exon19 del ) T669A mutant led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both EGFR and ERBB3 , and activation of PI3K @/@ AKT signaling , mimicking the effect of MEK inhibition ( Figure 6C ) .
As expected , addition of AZD6244 failed to further augment ERBB3 and AKT phosphorylation in cells expressing the 669A mutant .
These results demonstrate that EGFR T669 phosphorylation is necessary for MEK @/@ ERK to suppress EGFR @-@ mediated activation of ERBB3 .
This supports the hypothesis that a dominant ERK feedback on ERBB3 @/@ PI3K @/@ AKT is mediated though phosphorylation of T669 on EGFR ( or T677 HER2 ) .
Montero @-@ Conde et al. “ Relief of feedback inhibition of HER3 transcription by RAF and MEK inhibitors attenuates their antitumor effects in BRAF mutant thyroid carcinomas . ” ( PMC3651738 )
We next examined the mechanisms accounting for the increase in HER3 by MAPK pathway inhibitors in BRAF mutant thyroid cell lines .
Upregulation of HER3 has been found to mediate resistance to PI3K @/@ AKT ( 26 ) or HER2 ( 27 ) inhibitors in HER2 @-@ amplified breast cancer cell lines , which is caused in part through a FoxO3A @-@ dependent induction of HER3 gene transcription .
As shown in Fig. 5A , PLX4032 treatment increased HER3 and HER2 mRNAs in all six BRAF @-@ mutant thyroid cancer cell lines tested .

The effects of the MEK inhibitor on total HER2 , HER3 protein and on pHER3 were dose dependent , and inversely associated with the degree of inhibition of pERK ( Fig. 5B ) .
RAF or MEK inhibitors induced luciferase activity of a HER3 promoter construct spanning ~ 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site in 8505C cells .
Serial deletions identified a minimal HER3 promoter retaining transcriptional response to vemurafenib and AZD6244 , which was located between -@ 401 and -@ 42 bp ( Fig. 5C ) .
This region does not contain any predicted FoxO binding sites .
Moreover , PLX4032 led to an increase in phosphorylation of FoxO1 @/@ 3A between 4 @–@ 10h after addition of compound ( not shown ) , which is known to promote its dissociation from DNA , and likely discards involvement of these factors as transcriptional regulators of HER3 in response to MAPK pathway inhibition .
The minimal HER3 promoter region regulated by MAPK inhibitors overlaps with sequences previously described to be immunoprecipitated using antibodies against the ZFN217 transcription factor and CtBP1 @/@ CtBP2 corepressors ( 28 @–@ 30 ) .
CtBPs have also been described to negatively regulate transcriptional activity of the HER3 promoter in breast carcinoma cell lines ( 30 ) .
Silencing of CtBP1 , and to a lesser extent CtBP2 , increased basal HER3 in 8505C cells , and markedly potentiated the effects of PLX4032 ( Fig. 5D and 5E ) .
Knockdown of these factors modestly increased basal and PLX4032 @-@ induced HER2 levels , which likely contributes to the remarkable increase in pHER3 we observed ( Fig. 5D and 5E ) .
Finally , CtBP1 and CtBP2 chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed decreased binding to the HER3 promoter after treatment with PLX4032 ( Fig. 5F ) .
These findings were confirmed in a second cell line ( Supplementary Fig. S5A ) .
The increase in expression of HER3 after MAPK inhibition is due to activation of gene transcription , which was associated with a reduction of binding of the transcriptional repressors CTBP1 and CTBP2 to the HER3 gene promoter .
These corepressors have been previously linked to inhibition of HER3 transcription through promoter regions that show overlapping occupancy with ZNF217 , a transcription factor also involved in HER3 regulation ( 30 ) .
Accordingly , knockdown of CTBPs acutely induced HER3 expression and phosphorylation in thyroid cancer cells .
MAPK inhibition may dictate a chromatin redistribution of these repressors , and thus activate HER3 transcription .
The biochemical mechanisms involved in delocalization of CtBPs by MAPK inhibition have not been explored , but posttranslational modifications are known to regulate the repressive activity of CtBPs either by translocation to the cytoplasm or by targeting them for degradation ( 36 , 37 ) .

At a GAP @-@ to @-@ Ras ratio of 1 @:@ 500 , we observed an order of magnitude increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis for unmodified Ras relative to the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis .
No increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis was observed for mUbRas in the presence of the same GAP @-@ to Ras ratio ( Fig. 5b ) .
Therefore , mUbRas is insensitive to GAP @-@ mediated regulation , similar to an oncogenic Ras @-@ G12V mutation .
We obtained similar results using K-Ras ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) , indicating that the effects of monoubiquitination on Ras are not isoform @-@ specific .
To verify that the differences between the enzymatic and chemical ubiquitination linkers ( seven bonds and five bonds , respectively ) do not alter GAP @-@ responsiveness , we placed an additional cysteine at the c-terminus of Ubiquitin ( Ubiquitin @-@ C77 ) , thereby creating a linker one bond longer than the native linker .
We measured the rate of GAP @-@ mediated GTP hydrolysis and observed that the response of Ras ligated to Ubiquitin @-@ C77 was identical to Ras ligated to Ubiquitin @-@ G76C ( Fig. 5b ) .
These results indicate that variations in the linker length on this scale ( 1 @-@ 2 bonds ) do not influence the sensitivity of mUbRas to GAP downregulation .
To validate the use of an in vitro system to dissect the mechanism of Ras regulation , we measured the sensitivity of mUbRas to GAP @-@ mediated hydrolysis in a cellular reconstitution system .
We immunoprecipitated Ras from HEK293T cells and compared the sensitivity of the monoubiquitinated and unmodified fractions of Ras to regulation by GAP .
As seen in Figure 5c , monoubiquitinated K-Ras is less sensitive than the unmodified protein to GAP @-@ mediated GTP hydrolysis .
These data support our in vitro findings that monoubiquitination increases the population of active , GTP @-@ bound Ras through a defect in sensitivity to GAP @-@ mediated regulation .
Passage 1 @-@ 2 ( Discussion @/@ Conclusion )
It was established recently that monoubiquitination increases the proportion of Ras that is in the activated ( GTP @-@ bound ) state , that monoubiquitination enhances association with the downstream effectors Raf and PI3-Kinase , and that mutation of the primary site of monoubiquitination impairs oncogenic Ras @-@ mediated tumorigenesis .
Here we show that monoubiquitination decreases the sensitivity of Ras to GAP @-@ mediated hydrolysis .
A major advance was our ability to easily generate mUbRas , modified at a single site , in a form suitable for detailed biophysical studies .
This chemical ligation strategy will likely be useful for the study of other monoubiquitinated proteins .
Surprisingly , monoubiquitination did not alter the intrinsic activity of Ras , despite the size of the modification .
Our modeling and NMR analyses indicated that Ubiquitin dynamically samples a broad surface area of Ras that alters switch region dynamics .
These results led us to examine the effect of monoubiquitination on the interaction of Ras with its cognate GEF and GAPs , which also target the switch domains .
The analysis revealed that monoubiquitination abrogates GAP @-@ mediated GTP hydrolysis .
All other activities , including the ability to bind regulators , were largely preserved and our kinetic modeling suggests that the GAP defect will dominate .
Furthermore , this outcome was specific to monoubiquitination at position 147 .
Thus our work establishes an entirely new mode of Ras activation in which signaling is sustained even in the absence of hormone stimulus or oncogene mutation .
Phosphorylation of ASPP2 by RAS @/@ MAPK Pathway Is Critical for Its Full Pro @-@ Apoptotic Function ( PMC3847091 )
Passage 1 @-@ 1 ( Results )
It has recently been shown that oncogenic RAS can enhance the apoptotic function of p53 via ASPP1 and ASPP2 .
Mechanistically ASPP1 and ASPP2 bind RAS @-@ GTP and potentiates RAS signalling to enhance p53 mediated apoptosis [ 2 ] .
As RAS is upstream of several signalling cascades [ 13 ] , we queried whether the activity of ASPP2 is regulated by the activation of a RAS @-@ mediated signalling pathway .
One of the most studied downstream pathways of RAS signalling is the Raf @-@ MAPK pathway .
Interestingly , we observed two conserved putative MAPK phosphorylation sites in ASPP1 and ASPP2 .
The ASPP1 sites are at residues 671 and 746 , and the ASPP2 sites are at residues 698 and 827 ( Figure 1A ) .
We thus tested whether RAS activation may regulate ASPP2 phosphorylation .
An in vitro phophorylation assay was performed with a purified C-terminus fragment of ASPP2 ( 693 @-@ 1128 ) containing both MAPK putative phosphorylation sites .
When compared to p38 SAPK , MAPK1 was clearly able to phosphorylate the ASPP2 fragment in vitro ( Figure 1B , left and middle panels ) .
As shown in Figure S1 , histone 2B phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had high levels of incorporated 32P , suggesting that p38 SAPK was active ; while under the same conditions , ASPP2 ( 693 @-@ 1128 ) fragment phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had very low levels of incorporated 32P , indicating that p38 SAPK is not an efficient kinase for ASPP2 phosphorylation .
The phosphorylated ASPP2 fragment by MAPK1 was digested by trypsin and fractioned on a high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) .
Each eluted fraction was measured for its radioactivity content ( Figure 1B , right panel ) .
The fractions representing these radioactive peaks were analysed by mass spectrometry .
Of the two radioactive peaks , one represented the linker region between the GST and our ASPP2 fragment and the other corresponded to a fragment of the same mass as that containing the second putative phosphorylation site , serine 827 .
Hence ASPP2 can be phosphorylated at serine 827 by MAPK1 in vitro .
Passage 1 @-@ 2 ( Discussion @/@ Conclusion )
We and others have recently shown that ASPP2 can potentiate RAS signaling by binding directly via the ASPP2 N-terminus [ 2,6 ] .
Moreover , the RAS @-@ ASPP interaction enhances the transcription function of p53 in cancer cells [ 2 ] .
Until now , it has been unclear how RAS could affect ASPP2 to enhance p53 function .
We show here that ASPP2 is phosphorylated by the RAS @/@ Raf @/@ MAPK pathway and that this phosphorylation leads to its increased translocation to the cytosol @/@ nucleus and increased binding to p53 , providing an explanation of how RAS can activate p53 pro @-@ apoptotic functions ( Figure 5 ) .
Additionally , RAS @/@ Raf @/@ MAPK pathway activation stabilizes ASPP2 protein , although the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated .
Binding of armadillo to dTCF has been shown to reduce the ability of CBP to catalyze this reaction , perhaps by steric interference [ 97 ] .
In particular , the dCtBP corepressor may interact with Ttk69 to form a repressive complex for transcriptional repression .
The N-termini of XTcf-3 and LEF-1 interact with the Armadillo repeat region of beta-catenin ( Behrens et al. , 1996 ; Huber et al. , 1996 ; Molenaar et al. , 1996 ) .
Activation of p53 Sequence @-@ Specific DNA Binding by Acetylation of the p53 C-Terminal Domain .
The nonmodular activation regions contain a TFIID interaction domain that binds specifically to TAFII110 and TAFII250 .
( E ) The TALE motif does not prevent PBX binding to CBP , but changing an arginine to lysine within HD helix 3 increases CBP binding to PBX .
Given that p53 interacts with p300 @/@ CBP ( 3 , 26 , 51 ) , the same membrane was then probed with polyclonal anti @-@ CBP antibodies , which detect both p300 and CBP ( 4 , 56 ) .
Huckebein , Hairy , Goosecoid , and Engrailed are among the repressors that interact with Groucho ( Paroush et al. 1994 ; Goldstein et al. 1999 ) , whereas Kruppel , Knirps , and Snail interact with dCtBP ( Nibu et al. 1998a ) .
For example , abd-A depends on exd for the regulation of wg , but not for the regulation of dpp [ 14 ] .
This suggests that Exd is required to release the transcriptional activation function of Dfd independently of Exd enhancement of Dfd @-@ binding affinity on the composite site .
Ttk activates ftz transcription in yeast cells
In summary , the genetic analysis of dCtBP mutants suggests that Kruppel , Knirps and Snail depend on dCtBP+ activity , while Hairy and Dorsal continue to function as repressors in the absence of the dCtBP co-repressor .
Unilateral photoactivation of UBX repressed ANTP expression on one side of the embryo , indicating that the photo @-@ induced UBX was functional ( Fig. 3C ) .
Binding of PC and TRX to Ubx , abd-A and Abd-B promoters during different embryonic stages .
Su ( fu ) regulates Ci via two distinct mechanisms
Thus , the difference between Knirps and other short @-@ range transcriptional repressors may indicate that the mechanism of repression is not identical between these proteins , even though Giant , Knirps , and Kruppel all interact with the CtBP .
B-C , dCtBP and Groucho can bind Hairy simultaneously in vitro .
Repression of hth by Antp is cell autonomous .
Whereas , 24B => Ubx represses both Scr and Antp , leaving abd-A unaffected ( Fig. 4E-H ) .
The Ras signaling cascade leads to activation of the inductive transcription factor , Pnt , and inactivation of the Yan repressor .
H3 was strongly acetylated in the active Abd-B and RpII140 promoters ( Fig. 1a , g ; p10 , p10b , pol2 ) , whereas the inactive loci ( iab-4 , abd-A , Ubx , en , ems and bw ) showed a decrease ( 5 - 10 times lessR than the H3 signal in the active Abd-B and RpII140 promoters ) or absence of acetylation both at the core promoters as well as downstream of the initiator ( Fig. 1b - f , h ) .
Since Phyl and Sina associate with the Ttk complex without reducing its apparent size , it indicates that Sina and Phyl bind to Ttk without altering its ability to multimerize .
In summary , transgenic embryos for wg @-@ Gal4 @/@ UAS @-@ GFP or ems @-@ Gal4 @/@ UAS @-@ GFP accurately reproduce the expression of wg or ems that depends on AbdA or AbdB .
Table I dCtBP specifically interacts with Hairy and E ( spl ) mdelta bHLH family members in directed yeast two @-@ hybrid assays ( beta-galactosidase activity in diploid yeast strains )
dCtBP was identified in interaction studies with Knirps , Snail , and Hairy ( Nibu et al. , 1998b ; Poortinga et al. , 1998 ) These repressor proteins interact with dCtBP through CtBP binding motifs located within the repressor domains located near their C-terminal ends .
( E ) Association of Sina with HA @-@ tagged Ttk is specifically enhanced by Phyl .
In the bug Oncopeltus fasciatus , Dfd can not activate pb because pb is not even present in the maxillae ( 30 ) .
We have also tested if Trl and PcG genes interact to silence the endogenous Ubx gene and MCP reporter constructs in double heterozygous animals .
In these studies , Gro was found to interact specifically with Hairy and Hairy @-@ related proteins , and maternally expressed Gro was shown to be required for the transcriptional repression of genes that direct Drosophila segmentation , neurogenesis , and sex @-@ determination -- three processes known to be regulated by Hairy family repressors .
Recent studies have demonstrated that the Sina and Phyl proteins form a ternary complex with Ttk and promote ubiquitination and rapid degradation of Ttk through the proteasome pathway ( 14 , 22 ) .
If this model is correct , iab-4 mutations must therefore affect abd-A expression in a specific subset of mesodermal cells which they were not able to identify .
Dm @-@ Ftz generated strong segmentation phenotypes and interacted strongly with Ftz @-@ F1 , Tc @-@ Ftz caused moderate phenotypes and interacted with Ftz @-@ F1 to a lesser extent than Dm @-@ Ftz , while Sg @-@ Ftz generated extremly weak phenotypes and only interacted marginally with Ftz @-@ F1 .
Regulation of pb expression by Dfd and Scr
While iab-2 , iab-3 and iab-4 regulate abd-A in PS7 , PS8 and PS9 respectively , iab-5 , iab-6 , iab-7 and iab-8 regulate Abd-B expression in PS10 , PS11 , PS12 and PS13 .
In fact , all PRD => Hox combinations , except Lab ( data not shown ) and Dfd ( Fig. 3D ) , negatively regulate mesodermal pb expression ( data not shown ) .
Mutations in dTCF and expression of a dominant @-@ negative dTCF transgene cause a segment polarity phenotype and affect expression of the Wingless target genes engrailed and Ultrabithorax .
Treatment with either of the PI 3-kinase inhibitors , wortmannin or LY294002 , or the MEK inhibitor PD 098059 , which prevents MAPK signaling , attenuated the dexamethasone stimulation of TER without affecting apical junction remodeling .
The recent finding that the dCtBP protein interacts with the repressors Knirps and Snail ( 14 ) and Hairy ( 17 ) supports this notion .
Later in development , the transcription patterns in Mcp mutant and yw67 embryos are indistinguishable , suggesting that the Mcp deletion disrupts iab4 transcription only early in development .
We present evidence that Apterous activity depends on the formation of a LIM homeodomain dimer bridged by a dimer of cofactor .
Brinker is an antagonist of the Dpp @-@ signaling because it prevents the transcription of a subset of Mad activated genes ( Kirkpatrick et al. , 2001 ; Rushlow et al. , 2001 ; Saller and Bienz , 2001 ) , but Brinker is itself a Dpp target ( Minami et al. , 1999 ) because Mad and Schnurri heterodimers can block brk transcription in dpp @-@ responsive cells ( Marty et al. , 2000 ) .
CtBP and Giant exhibited repression activity similar to the Knirps repression domains .
Pan is bound and its transcriptional activity inhibited by dCBP ( 33 ) .
Similarly , ectopic Scr and Dfd proteins have no effect on lab gene expression while we find positive regulation of pb by Dfd and Scr as discussed above .
Impact of CSN @-@ specific phosphorylation on degradation of p53 wt and p53 mutants by the Ub - 26S proteasome system Ub - 26S proteasome @-@ dependent degradation of p53 was studied in reticulocyte lysate containing an intact Ub - 26S proteasome system and the CSN complex .
E6 promotes the ubiquitin @-@ mediated degradation of p53 by the proteasome .
The exception to this hierarchy is seen for pb where we find that ectopic epidermal expression of Scr and Dfd actually activate epidermal pb expression ( Fig. 3 ) .
beta-catenin contains amino @- and carboxy @-@ terminal transcriptional activation domains and a covalent fusion of either domain with the amino terminus of LEF-1 generates a fusion protein that functions constitutively and activates transcription independently of a Wnt signal ( 19 ) . .
Binding to Mdm2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 ( Momand et al. , 1992 ; Oliner et al. , 1993 ) and promotes the degradation of p53 by the 26S proteasome ( Haupt et al. , 1997 ; Kubbutat et al. , 1997 ; Honda et al. , 1997 ) .
Functionally , CBP and p300 enhance CREB @-@ mediated transcription upon PKA activation [ 1,2,4 ] .
Purified CREB and CREMalpha proteins were then phosphorylated with PKA .
Although a mammalian homologue of STE5 has not yet been identified , two proteins , MP1 and JIP-1 , have been suggested to function as a scaffold for MAPK modules that leads to specific activation of ERK and JNK ( 41 , 52 ) .
Since the Asp replacement at Ser greatly decreases , but does not completely block , the activation of CREB by PKA , it is possible that the effect of this mutation is a quantitative rather than a complete block of CREB binding to CBP .
p300 @/@ CBP interacts with CREB , E1A , PCAF , c-jun , c-fos , c-Myb , MyoD , and TFIIB
Somatostatin exerts its antiproliferative effect inhibiting more upstream the TSH stimulation of PKA and PI 3-kinase , interfering with the TSH @-@ mediated increases of intracellular cAMP levels by inactivation of adenylyl cyclase activity .
We have previously shown that when the four consensus PKA sites are mutated , CI is no longer proteolyzed , regulated by PKA , or regulated by hedgehog signaling to activate wg ( 7 , 8 ) .
PKA and MAPK lead to the activation of CREB and to the induction of immediate @-@ early genes , one of which -- the ubiquitin hydrolase -- is neuron specific .
Coexpressing axin inhibited the Lef-1 reporter activation induced by CKI ( Fig. 3 b ) .
Activation of alpha 1A Adrenergic Receptors in Rat1 Cells Does Not Activate MAPK and RSK2 -- Other investigators have reported that activation of MAPK ( ERK1 and ERK2 ) by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor can lead to CREB phosphorylation and stimulation of gene expression via CRE elements ( 17 ) .
These findings indicate that a PKA @-@ dependent event other than CREB Ser133 phosphorylation is required for Ca2+ induction of CaRE @-@ dependent transcription .
In vertebrates , PKA promotes proteolytic cleavage of Gli3 , a Ci orthologue , and negatively regulates transcriptional activation of Gli1 , indicating that this antagonistic relationship is evolutionarily conserved .
Together , these data demonstrate that JIP3 interacts with proteins that can form a MAPK signaling module , including JNK , MKK7 , and MLK3 .
Ptc and Hh act in parallel on Fu and Ci to regulate transcription of wg and ptc . Ptc and PKA inhibit activation of wg and ptc by Ci , while Hh counteracts this inhibition .
Our in vitro kinase assays clearly show that the N-terminal arm of the homeodomain of SCR is phosphorylated specifically by PKA but not by PKC ( Figure 3C ) .
To test whether Mae mediates phosphorylation of Ser 127 of Yan , we examined in vitro phosphorylation of Yan by activated Erk ( see Methods ) .
The increase of PKA phosphorylation on CSRD was independent of the PKA catalytic activation by DDAH , because DDAH could not increase PKA phosphorylation of other PKA substrates such as MBP ( Fig. 5 ) .
Expression of delta @-@ ID or wild-type TR did not significantly affect p53 levels as revealed by a Western blot analysis with an antibody that specifically detects a wild-type p53 protein ( Fig. 3 B ) .
The kinase activity of KSR was determined by in vitro reconstitution of the MAPK signaling cascade using MBP phosphorylation as a readout .
ICAT effectively blocked the binding of Tcf to -@ catenin , whereas it did not block the binding of C-cadherin to - catenin ( Figure 6 ) .
As shown in Fig. 4 A , the phosphorylation of MBP by GST @-@ Shk1 deltaN118 was significantly greater for protein isolated from cells that overexpressed Skb5 than from cells that did not , while autophosphorylation of GST @-@ Shk1 deltaN118 was only slightly increased for protein isolated from cells that overexpressed Skb5 ( Fig. 4 A ) .
The N-terminal domain of TAF130 directly interacts with the DNA @-@ binding surface of TBP and therefore acts as a significant inhibitor of TFIID binding to TATA elements ( 21 , 22 , 29 ) .
Interestingly , Baker et al. ( Baker et al. , 2001 ) also suggest that MAE binds to the PD of PNT @-@ P2 , and enhances the transcriptional activation of PNT @-@ P2 , leading them to propose that MAE promotes PNT @-@ P2 phosphorylation by MAPK .
Normal levels of MCMs coprecipitated with M9 and M10 , while greatly reduced levels of MCMs were bound to M6 , M7 , and M8 .

Our results , showing a crosstalk between the PKA and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and p38 alpha kinases through the tyrosine phosphatase PTP @-@ SL , support the existence of a novel mechanism by which PKA can regulate the activity of the MAP kinases and their translocation to the nucleus ( Figure 5 ) .
Since CBP and p300 are inhibited by E1A , these results indicate that Rho GDI modulates ER activity through an E1A @-@ sensitive step that most likely requires the activity of CBP @/@ p300 .
As E1A is a specific inhibitor of CBP , these data strongly indicate that CBP is an essential factor for TRH stimulation of the TSH subunit genes in the pituitary .
It is likely that structural integrity of the binding site is required for strong binding of E1A peptides to CtBP , although predominately unstructured peptides bind weakly .
Sp1 enhances recruitment of TFIID to the A20 promoter .
The carboxyl terminus of E1A binds to a protein called CtBP whose properties appear to be the opposite of CBP @/@ p300 ( 25 ) .
Inhibition of p300 @/@ CBP by E1A , E1A @-@ RG2 , and p300N interferes with mesoderm and endoderm development .
Coexpression of PKC mu with PKC inhibits PKC -@ mediated JNK activity .
To determine specifically whether the P @- X-D-L-R motif ( residues 23 @-@ 27 ) of MITR was responsible for all CtBP @-@ binding activity , we mutated residues DL to AS , which has been shown previously to abolish CtBP binding to the E1a oncoprotein ( 20 ) .
This finding is based on the observations that ( i ) PML repressed the transcription of the EGFR promoter by targeting a 150 @-@ bp 5 ' element of the promoter that is driven by the transcription factor Sp1 ; ( ii ) PML and Sp1 interacted both in vitro and in vivo through specific domains ; ( iii ) PML specifically disrupted the binding of Sp1 to target DNA ; and ( iv ) expression of exogenous PML inhibited Sp1 @-@ mediated transcription of Sp1 target promoters in Sp1 @-@ negative Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells .
Modulation of E1A Activities by CtBP
These findings suggest a complex reciprocal relationship between regulation of adducin function by calmodulin binding and phosphorylation by PKA and PKC .
The human Cut is phosphorylated by protein kinase C ( PKC ) and by casein kinase II ( CKII ) ( 14 , 16 ) , the rat TTF-1 is phosphorylated by MST2 kinase and by PKC ( 3 , 60 ) , the murine Pit-1 ( mPit-1 ) and murine Oct-1 ( mOct-1 ) are phosphorylated by PKA ( 33 , 51 ) , and Drosophila Engrailed and Antennapedia ( 7 , 32 ) are phosphorylated by CKII .
ELISAs were performed and the equilibrium dissociation constant , Kd for dCtBP binding to E1A assessed ( Fig. 2 ) .
By analogy to pRB , which is inactivated upon E1A binding ( Nevins , 1992 ) , it is assumed that E1A inactivates growth suppressing functions of p300 and CBP .
GST alone did not bind calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA and neither GST @-@ dUNC13 or any other fusion protein described below bound to agarose beads under any Ca2+ conditions ( data not shown ; Ref . 21 ) .
Predictably , Sp1 failed to interact with GST as well ( lane 1 ) .
Since Sp1 binds and requires dTAFII110 for activation in vitro ( 29 ) , it has been suggested that dTAFII110 may function as a coactivator by serving as a site of protein @-@ protein contacts between Sp1 and the TFIID complex .
SPC induces activation of MAPK by a PKC @-@ dependent pathway .
These results indicate that TFIID @/@ RNA pol II may act synergistically with GAGA factor to create the HS sites .
Inhibition of p300 @/@ CBP by EBF . E1A , Twist , Pu.1 , and the Hox family of DNA binding proteins bind to , yet inhibit , p300 @/@ CBP HAT activity ( 7 , 18 , 19 , 39 , 44 ) .
In line with a previous characterization of this model of stably transfected keratinocytes ( 5 ) and with other results ( 24 ) , we conclude that E1A @-@ induced enhancement of radiosensitivity depends on E1A binding to both p300 @/@ CBP and pRb proteins .
Indeed , T-cell receptor stimulation induces CREB phosphorylation through a PKC @-@ dependent pathway that also requires MAPK activation ( 206 ) .
In an attempt to further establish the importance of Sp1 binding to intron bp 618 @-@ 626 in serum @-@ induced expression of TTP , we created a substitution mutant in which the Sp1 binding motif was replaced by a binding site for the yeast trans @-@ activator protein GAL4 ( 5 -@ CGGAAGACTCTCCTCCG-3 ( 54 ) ) .
DNase I footprinting identifies the binding of Sp1 to the -@ 279 site .
While p21 has recently been reported to activate the MAPK kinase kinase activity of Raf-1 through the mediation of 14-3-3 ( 24 , 25 ) , it is not clear whether PKC activates the MAPK cascade via Raf-1 , MEK kinase , the mammalian homologue of yeast STE11 ( 26 ) , or both .
For instance , TAFII250 can acetylate and ubiquitinate histones as well as regulate TBP access to DNA ( M IZZEN et al. 1996 ;
E1A interacts with p300 @/@ CBP , a coactivator of FER-1 , inhibiting the adaptor function of p300 @/@ CBP and leading to repression of ferritin H transcription .
Peptide competition assays demonstrated that the interaction of E1A with CtBP is also blocked by Lys-239 acetylation .
Comparison of the amount of oligonucleotide in the DNA @-@ protein complex with a set of standard dilutions of free oligonucleotide demonstrated that 11.88 nM of chondrocyte nuclear protein was bound to the Sp1 oligonucleotide in the reaction , assuming a one @-@ to @-@ one binding of the probe and the Sp1 oligonucleotide .
Several Ser @/@ hr phosphorylation sites were identified in the regulatory C-terminal segment , including phosphorylation of Ser 378 by PKC ( protein kinase C ) and two sites , Ser 352 and 386 , whose phosphorylation was regulated in a cell cycle @-@ dependent manner [ 18 ] .
Akt , an Inhibitor of GSK-3 , Increases GR Transcriptional Enhancement -- We next asked whether a decrease in GSK-3 activity would increase GR transcriptional activation .
One is that PKA directly phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3 beta efficiently in the AKAP220 complex ; the other is that AKAP220 and PKA inhibit PP1 co @-@ operatively , thereby enhancing the phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta and inhibiting the GSK-3 beta activity .
Thus , these results demonstrate that PS1 strongly promotes GSK-3 beta @-@ dependent sequential phosphorylation of Thr41 , Ser37 , and Ser33 , starting presumably from a GSK-3 beta @-@ independent priming event on S45 .
TSH and Rap1 regulate Akt phosphorylation .
CBP @-@ catalyzed acetylation of lysine residues within histones helps to remodel chromatin structure into a form that is accessible to active transcription .
TPA stimulates GSK-3 phosphorylation and downregulation of intracellular PKC activity inhibits the effect of LPA on GSK-3 .
These data confirm the sequencing results obtained with PKA phosphorylation of the fusion proteins .
Therefore , to explore further the mechanism by which Pin1 inhibits the CK2 @-@ catalyzed phosphorylation of Thr-1342 , we investigated the possibility that Pin1 also interacts with topoisomerase II using GST @-@ Pin1 pulldown assays .
Collectively , these results indicate that Pin1 is not a general inhibitor of CK2 .
transportin can simultaneously bind an M9 domain ( import signal of hnRNP A1 ) and a BIB domain , but apparently it can not import the two at the same time ( Jakel and Gorlich , 1998 ) .
Activated PKA then inhibits ERK2 , possibly acting via the small GTP @-@ binding protein RAS ( Knetsch et al. , 1996 ; Aubry et al. , 1997 ) .
Boxes show the IP4 @-@ sensitive isoforms of synaptotagmin , but the broken box indicates weak IP4 binding ability ( synaptotagmin VI ) .
Transportin Mediates the Nuclear Import of M9 @-@ Bearing Proteins
GSK-3 is phosphorylated and inhibited by PKC in vitro ( 59 ) and in phorbol ester - treated H4IIE cells ( P.A.L. , unpublished observations ) .
The inhibitory effect of Cpd 5 on CREB activity was most likely mediated by ERK phosphorylation because MEK inhibitors PD 98059 and U-0126 partially blocked Cpd 5 @-@ mediated CREB hypophosphorylation and inhibition of CREB @-@ regulated gene transcription .
This conclusion is based on the observations that insulin @-@ induced inhibition of GSK-3 is blocked in cells treated with wortmannin or LY 294002 ( 9 , 17 ) ; coexpression of GSK-3 beta with wild-type or constitutively active Akt results in the inhibition of GSK-3 activity ( 10 ) ; expression of a dominant @-@ negative mutant of Akt blocks the effect of insulin on GSK-3 beta ( 18 ) ; and Akt phosphorylates and inactivates both GSK-3 isoforms in vitro ( 9 ) .
This phosphorylation depends on the Pnt domain of Yan ( Fig. 3d , compare lanes 4 and 7 with lanes 6 and 8 ) , indicating that the ability of Mae to promote Erk @-@ directed phosphorylation of Ser 127 is dependent on binding of Mae to Yan .
Distinct Roles for GLI3 and GLI1 in Shh Signaling -- In Drosophila , Hh signaling inhibits association of the Ci @-@ Cos2 @-@ Fu @- Su ( fu ) complex with the cytoskeleton and cleavage of Ci into a repressor form on the A-P border ( 18 , 19 , 25 , 11 ) .
Absence of Hh leads to the incorporation of Ci into a microtubule @-@ associated complex , where Ci is processed by default into Ci [ rep ] .
ERK activation and phosphorylation of CREB were both inhibited by U0126 , consistent with the notion that odorants stimulate CREB phosphorylation through the MEK @/@ ERK @/@ p90 rsk pathway , one of the major pathways that mediates Ca2+ stimulation of CREB phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells ( 37 ) .
According to crystallographic studies of a PD bound to a PAX6 consensus binding site , neither of these mutations is involved in direct DNA contact ( 23 ) .
Because Hh induction of Ci nuclear import is not affected by Su ( fu ) in cos2 mutant cells near the A @/@ P compartment boundary ( Fig. 2D ) , we conclude that Su ( fu ) inhibits Ci activity at a step after it translocates into the nucleus .
Here , we provide evidence that Costal2 ( Cos2 ) and Suppressor of Fused [ Su ( fu ) ] inhibit Ci by tethering it in the cytoplasm , whereas Hh induces nuclear translocaltion of Ci through Fused ( Fu ) .
( C ) Stimulation of cells by high levels of Hh additionally promotes the dephosphorylation ( green arrow ) of Ci and activates ( green arrow ) the Fu S @/@ T kinase ( green oval ) , promoting dissociation of Ci from Su ( fu ) and stimulating its import into the nucleus , where it activates target genes such as Col and en in association with the coactivator CBP ( yellow circle ) .
For example , studies examining the mechanisms of long term facilitation in Aplysia have also indicated that regulation of ERK activity by PKA may be an important component of this process ( 16 ) .
High levels of Hh cause more complete dephosphorylation of Ci , which stimulates the activity of Ci155 , resulting in the expression of Hh @-@ responsive genes controlled by Ci155 .
Expression of Rap1 and B-Raf in Brown Adipocytes -- It has recently been shown that cAMP activates the Erk cascade through a PKA-, Rap1-, and B-Raf @-@ dependent signaling pathway ( 28 ) .
PKA regulates the activity of another widely studied inducible transcription factor , CREB .
The amino acids altered in mutation DECM2 ( YEG G ) , which have a strong effect on DEC binding to beta @-@ cateninArm in our assays , are bold and underlined .
The N-terminal region contains serine and threonine residues whose phosphorylation signals ubiquitin @-@ dependent degradation of cytosolic beta-catenin .
Interestingly , E-cadherin , which forms a complex with Calpha and beta-catenin and is normally located at the plasma membrane , changes location to the cytoplasm in Calpha @/@ mice , suggesting that Calpha but not Cbeta mediates binding of the E-cadherin complex to the plasma membrane ( 10 ) .
We previously found that 71 amino acid derivatives of the cytoplasmic tail of vertebrate N @- or E-cadherin inhibit beta-catenin @/@ TCF @-@ mediated transactivation when introduced into human colon cancer cells ( Sadot et al. , 1998 ; Simcha et al. , 1998 ) .
It will be interesting to determine whether the Raf protein kinase , one of the kinases that binds 14-3-3 ( Fu et al. 1994 ) , can phosphorylate and modulate dSlo , because Raf is a key player in the mitogen @-@ activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway that conveys signals from the plasma membrane to the cell nucleus ( Burbelo and Hall 1995 ) .

This is supported by the in vitro observations that Dvl inhibits GSK-3 beta @-@ dependent phosphorylation of Axin , APC , and beta-catenin in the Axin complex , although the bindings of GSK-3 beta , beta-catenin , and APC to Axin are not changed , and that Dvl does not affect GSK-3 beta activity to phosphorylate the peptide substrate ( 22 , 26 ) .
As demonstrated in Figure 5 , B and C , in the absence of neurotrophins , DRG neurons derived from NF1 @-@ deficient embryos exhibit elevated erk phosphorylation levels that are comparable to wild-type neurons in the presence of NGF .

These interactions are specific , because an E1A polypeptide that binds to the ASH1 binding region in dCBP blocks the GST @-@ ASH1 ( 47 @-@ 456 ) - dCBP interaction more efficiently than an E1A @-@ RG2 polypeptide that carries a mutation that reduces E1A binding to dCBP ( Fig. 7E ) .

The major known genetic risk factor for late @-@ onset AD is the 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) gene ( ApoE4 ) ; however , at least half of the people who develop AD do not carry ApoE4 , and not all who carry ApoE4 develop AD .
In addition , AD patients have increased serum levels of TNF and IL-6 have been established in [ 20 and 47 ] .
Indeed , Lad @/@ Ad interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFR and vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) KDR , as well as several components of receptor signaling networks , including Grb2 , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and phospholipase Cgamma ( PLC-gamma ) ( 11 , 41 , 58 ) .
Importantly , at least 10 of those known genes have been previously characterized in AD , which include p21 ras , mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) kinase 1 , alpha-enolase 1 , carbonyl reductase , apolipoprotein D , transferrin , phosphotriesterase protein , glutamate dehydrogenase , calpain , and Cu @/@ Zn superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) .
Furthermore , cortical neurons of AD patients express p75NTR , but this receptor is only infrequently expressed in cortical neurons of nonaffected aged @-@ matched controls ( 15 ) .
Considering the increasing evidence for neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer 's disease ( 50 @-@ 54 ) , the transcriptional control of PS1 and its down-regulation by p53 may relate directly to the pathology of the disease .
Recombinant Adenoviral Vectors and Adenoviral Infection -- The recombinant adenovirus vector AdCox-2 , expressing COX-2 , was constructed from replication @-@ deficient adenovirus type 5 ( Ad5 ) with deletions in the E1 and E3 genes , Ad dl327 , and a plasmid containing Ad5 sequences from 22 to 5790 with a deletion of the E1 region from bp 342 to 3523 , a polycloning site under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter , the COX-2 cDNA , and the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal .
We identify four S/TP sites of B-Raf phosphorylated by activated ERK and find that feedback phosphorylation of B-Raf inhibits binding to activated Ras and disrupts heterodimerization with C-Raf , which is dependent on the B-Raf pS729 @/@ pS14 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 binding site .
14-3-3 dimers bind to phosphorylation sites present in both the N @- and C-terminal regions and stabilize the autoinhibited state ( 22 ) .
To activate the Raf proteins , autoinhibition mediated by the N terminus must be relieved and the kinase domain must adopt the active catalytic conformation
Under normal signaling conditions , Ras activation helps mediate these events by recruiting the Raf proteins to the plasma membrane , which induces the release of 14-3-3 from the N-terminal binding site and facilitates phosphorylation of the Raf kinase domain ( 19 ) .
Once activated , either by upstream signaling or by mutational events , all Raf proteins are capable of initiating the phosphorylation cascade that results in the sequential activation of MEK and ERK .
Strikingly , the Raf proteins themselves are also substrates of activated ERK .
In regard to C-Raf , ERK @-@ dependent feedback phosphorylation has been shown to instigate a regulatory cycle whereby phosphorylation of the feedback sites down-modulates C-Raf signaling , after which the hyperphosphorylated C-Raf protein is dephosphorylated and returned to a signaling @-@ competent state through dephosphorylation events involving protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) and the Pin1 prolyl-isomerase ( 8 ) .
For B-Raf , two ERK @-@ dependent feedback sites , S750 and T753 , have been identified , and phosphorylation of these sites has been reported to have a negative regulatory effect
Here we find that both normal and oncogenic B-Raf proteins are phosphorylated on four S/TP sites ( S151 , T401 , S750 , and T753 ) by activated ERK .
Previously , we found that in response to growth factor treatment , signaling from C-Raf is downregulated by ERK @-@ dependent feedback phosphorylation on S/TP sites and that C-Raf is subsequently dephosphorylated and returned to a signaling @-@ competent state through the activities of PP2A and the Pin1 prolyl-isomerase ( 8 )
The Pin1 prolyl-isomerase binds specifically to phosphorylated S/TP ( pS @/@ TP ) motifs ( 33 ) , and isomerization of the pS @/@ TP bond is required for PP2A to efficiently dephosphorylate certain proteins , such as cdc25C , Myc , and C-Raf ( 16 ) .
Complex formation between B-Raf and Pin1 correlated with the phosphorylation of B-Raf on S/TP sites ( Fig. 1C ) and this interaction could be blocked when the MEK inhibitor U0126 was used to prevent ERK activation and the S/TP phosphorylation of B-Raf ( Fig. 1D ) .
Together , these findings indicate that Pin1 is needed for the efficient dephosphorylation of B-Raf and are consistent with the model that S/TP phosphorylation inhibits Raf signaling .
Eluting in HPLC fractions 78 to 79 was a peptide phosphorylated on S750 and T753 , the previously identified ERK sites , and eluting in fractions 26 and 58 to 59 were peptides phosphorylated at S151 and T401 , respectively .
All four of these identified sites are followed by a proline residue , and their phosphorylation could be blocked by pretreating cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 ( Fig. 2A ) , suggesting that these residues are feedback targets of the proline @-@ directed kinase , ERK .
Consistent with this model , we found that when purified activated ERK was incubated with kinase @-@ dead B-Raf ( K375M ) in vitro , ERK strongly phosphorylated B-Raf on the S151 , S750 , and T753 sites , with phosphorylation of T401 also observed ( Fig. 2B ) .
These findings are similar to what has been observed for C-Raf ( 8 ) and suggest that feedback phosphorylation is a conserved mechanism used to disrupt the Ras @/@ Raf interaction .
Consistent with these data , we found that B-Raf interacted with C-Raf in an inducible and transient manner following growth factor treatment ( Fig. 3B and C ) .
In addition , when B-Raf feedback phosphorylation was prevented , either by U0126 treatment or by mutation of all the feedback sites , an increase in the basal level of heterodimerization with C-Raf was observed , and heterodimerization in response to growth factor treatment was increased and prolonged ( Fig. 3B and C ) .
These findings support a model whereby feedback phosphorylation disrupts Raf heterodimerization .
Unlike WT B-Raf , oncogenic B-Raf proteins have been shown to heterodimerize constitutively with C-Raf in a Ras @-@ independent manner ( 11 ) .
When we next examined the effect of feedback phosphorylation on the ability of oncogenic B-Raf to form heterodimers with C-Raf , we found that the levels of endogenous C-Raf associating with B-Raf proteins of high ( V600E ) , intermediate ( G466A ) , and impaired ( D594G ) kinase activities all increased when the feedback sites were mutated , indicating that feedback phosphorylation also inhibits the heterodimerization of oncogenic B-Raf proteins ( Fig. 3D ) .
Previous studies have shown that , for both normal and oncogenic B-Raf proteins to heterodimerize with C-Raf , the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding site of C-Raf ( S621 ) must be intact ( 11 , 27 ) ( Fig. 3E ) .
To determine whether binding of 14-3-3 to B-Raf is also required for heterodimerization , B-Raf proteins containing lanine substitutions in the two 14-3-3 binding sites , S365 and S729 ( 2 ) , were examined for their abilities to heterodimerize with C-Raf in response to growth factor treatment .
Not surprisingly , given that mutation of the S365 14-3-3 binding site enhances the membrane localization of B-Raf ( 2 ) , increased heterodimerization with C-Raf was observed for S365A B-Raf compared to WT B-Raf ( Fig. 3F ) .
In contrast , S729A B-Raf failed to heterodimerize with C-Raf in response to growth factor treatment , and mutation of this site disrupted the constitutive interaction of oncogenic B-Raf proteins and C-Raf ( Fig. 3F ) , indicating that heterodimerization with C-Raf is dependent on the C-terminal S729 14-3-3 binding site of B-Raf .
Previous studies have found that all oncogenic B-Raf proteins can activate C-Raf and that heterodimerization with C-Raf is required for kinase @-@ impaired oncogenic B-Raf proteins to mediate ERK activation in vivo ( 31 ) .
Therefore , to further investigate both the impact of feedback phosphorylation and the contribution of heterodimerization to oncogenic B-Raf function , we examined the transformation potential of oncogenic B-Raf proteins containing mutations in either the feedback phosphorylation sites ( which exhibit increased heterodimerization ) or the S729 14-3-3 binding site ( which are unable to heterodimerize ) .
For these studies , FBm or S729A mutations were incorporated into a number of oncogenic B-Raf proteins that exhibit various levels of kinase activity .
The proteins were then expressed in NIH 3T3 cells and examined for their abilities to alter cell morphology and induce focus formation .
As shown in Fig. 4A , the FBm or S729A mutation had no effect on transformation induced by the V600E or G469A B-Raf protein , both of which possess high kinase activity .
However , mutation of the feedback sites significantly increased the transforming activities of B-Raf proteins with intermediate or impaired kinase activity ( Fig. 4A ) .
The total number of foci observed and , often , the sizes of the foci were increased , and cells within the foci exhibited a more transformed appearance .
In contrast , the S729A mutation reduced the transforming activities of the oncogenic proteins with intermediate or impaired kinase activity , causing a reduction in focus number and a flatter cell morphology ( Fig. 4A ) .
Examination of activated phospho @-@ MEK levels revealed that the FBm and S729 mutations had no effect on MEK activation induced by the high @-@ activity V600E B-Raf protein ; however , the FBm and S729A mutations increased and decreased , respectively , the abilities of the intermediate G466A and kinase @-@ impaired D594G B-Raf proteins to activate MEK ( Fig. 4B ) , indicating a correlation between the transformation potential of these proteins and their ability to activate ERK cascade signaling in vivo .
Not unexpectedly , for all of the oncogenic B-Raf proteins , the S729A mutation , which disrupts heterodimerization with C-Raf , caused a > 90 % decrease in C-Raf activity levels ( Fig. 5B ) .
Together , these findings indicate a correlation between the changes in the transformation potentials of the intermediate and impaired oncogenic B-Raf proteins and their abilities to heterodimerize and activate C-Raf .
To investigate the contributions of the various feedback sites to the overall effect of feedback phosphorylation on B-Raf function , we generated a panel of mutants in which specific feedback phosphorylation sites were incorporated into either WT B-Raf or the intermediate @-@ activity G466A B-Raf protein .
The mutant proteins were then examined for their abilities to heterodimerize with C-Raf and to bind activated Ras under conditions where feedback phosphorylation was induced ( in cycling cells for the G466A mutants and in cells treated with PDGF for 30 min for the WT B-Raf mutants ) .
As shown in Fig. 6A , only mutation of the S151 feedback site , which is in close proximity to the Ras binding domain ( residues 155 to 227 ) , was found to significantly increase binding to activated Ras .
In contrast , mutation of S151A , T401A , and S750A T753A were all found to increase C-Raf binding ( Fig. 6A ) , a finding consistent with peptide studies suggesting that there are multiple points of contact between heterodimerized B @- and C-Raf proteins ( 27 ) .
Interestingly , when the S729A mutation was introduced into the FBm mutant , binding to C-Raf was abolished ( Fig. 6A ) , indicating that the increased heterodimerization observed when the feedback sites are mutated is still dependent on 14-3-3 binding .
Given that oncogenic B-Raf proteins are targets of feedback phosphorylation , we next examined whether they might also be dephosphorylated and recycled in a manner involving the PP2A phosphatase and the Pin1 prolyl-isomerase .
As indicated in Fig. 7A , when PP2A was inhibited with okadaic acid treatment , slower @-@ migrating forms of the V600E , G466A , and D594G B-Raf proteins were found to accumulate .
Moreover , given their constitutive phosphorylation on S/TP sites ( Fig. 3D ) , these oncogenic B-Raf mutants were found to interact constitutively with Pin1 ( Fig. 7B ) , indicating that oncogenic B-Raf proteins are dephosphorylated and recycled .
Consistent with the model that Pin1 influences B-Raf signaling by facilitating the dephosphorylation of the feedback sites , overexpression of the Pin1 proteins had no effect on the transformation potential of G466A FBm-B-Raf , which lacks the sites of feedback phosphorylation .
Previous studies have found that both the C-Raf and B-Raf proteins are targets of ERK @-@ dependent feedback phosphorylation
In the case of C-Raf , six sites of feedback phosphorylation have been identified , five of which are direct targets of activated ERK ( 8 )
For B-Raf , previous work by Brummer et al. ( 3 ) identified the C-terminal S750 and T753 residues as sites phosphorylated by activated ERK .
Through metabolic labeling experiments , we find here that in addition to the S750 and T753 sites , B-Raf is feedback phosphorylated on two other sites , S151 and T401 .
These residues are phosphorylated by activated ERK in vitro ,
As has been observed for C-Raf , we find that the hyperphosphorylated B-Raf protein is subsequently dephosphorylated in a manner requiring the activities of the PP2A phosphatase and Pin1 prolyl-isomerase , indicating that the feedback phosphorylation @/@ dephosphorylation cycle is a conserved regulatory mechanism for the Raf proteins .
Through mutational analysis , we find that feedback phosphorylation disrupts the abilities of B-Raf to bind activated Ras and to heterodimerize with C-Raf .
Although phosphorylation of the S151 site appears to have the greatest effect on Ras binding , our results indicate that phosphorylation of all the feedback sites contributes to the inhibition of C-Raf binding .
This finding is consistent with those of peptide binding studies conducted by Rushworth et al. ( 27 ) indicating that there are multiple points of contact between heterodimerized B-Raf and C-Raf proteins .
Interestingly , these peptide binding studies also indicate that homodimerized B-Raf and C-Raf proteins have multiple contact points ( 27 ) , suggesting that feedback phosphorylation of the Raf proteins may disrupt Raf homodimers as well
Taken together , these findings suggest a model whereby the binding of a 14-3-3 dimer to the C-terminal pS621 site of C-Raf and the C-terminal pS729 site of B-Raf provides the stable docking event that then allows the two proteins to make additional contacts ( Fig. 9 ) .
The most frequently mutated oncogenes in the deadliest cancers responsible for human mortality are KRAS , PIK3CA and BRAF .
Importantly the signaling enzymes encoded by PIK3CA and BRAF are , in part , regulated by direct binding to activated forms of the Ras proteins suggesting that dysregulation of this key step in signaling is critical for tumor formation .
Ras acts as a molecular switch that is activated upon GTP loading and deactivated upon hydrolysis of GTP to GDP .
This switch mechanism is common to a wide variety of GTP - binding proteins and is mediated by a conserved structure called the G - domain that consists of five conserved G boxes .
Under physiological conditions , the rate of GDP or GTP release from the G - domain is slow .
As a consequence the GDP produced by GTP hydrolysis on Ras is trapped and the bulk of cellular Ras accumulates in the GDP - bound ‘ off ’ state , despite the high GTP @/@ GDP ratio in the cytosol ( 1 – 3 ) .
Growth factors can turn on Ras by activating Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors ( GEFs ) or by inhibiting the GTPase Activating Proteins ( GAPs ) or by both mechanisms .
RasGEFs bind to Ras and lower the transition energy for the nucleotide exchange of the bound GDP for the more abundant cytosolic GTP , whereas RasGAPs bind to Ras and catalyze GTP hydrolysis .
The most prevalent oncogenic mutations in Ras ( Gly12 and Gly13 in the G1 box , and Gln61 in the G3 box ) preserve the GTP bound state by inhibiting intrinsic GTPase activity and by interfering with the ability of GAPs .
Other less frequently observed mutations , such as those found in the G4 and G5 boxes , increase the rate of nucleotide exchange , thereby mimicking the GEFs and increasing the GTP - bound state ( 1 – 7 ) .
Activated Ras controls diverse signaling pathways that ultimately determine Ras - induced cellular responses such as cell proliferation , survival , differentiation and motility .
These multiple Ras functions depend on its binding to a range of functionally diverse effector molecules such as Raf , PI3K , AF6 and RASSFs ( 1 ) .
The enhancement of specific effector pathways plays a critical role in maintaining an appropriate biological response ( 8 ) .
The specificity in Ras - induced signaling is primarily determined by the balance between Ras affinity for each of its effectors and the local concentrations of those effectors .
In addition , scaffold proteins have been shown to guide activation of specific effector pathway ( s ) . For example , SHOC2 @/@ Sur-8 bridges Ras and Raf to specifically enhance the Raf @/@ MEK @/@ ERK pathway without enhancing PI3K @/@ AKT signaling ( 9 , 10 ) .
We utilized an unbiased mass spectrometry - based approach to identify ubiquitination sites of Ras .
His - tagged ubiquitin and Flag - tagged K-Ras4B ( K-Ras hereafter ) were expressed in HEK293T cells at levels similar to endogenous K-Ras ( Fig. 1B ) and subjected to sequential affinity chromatography .
His - ubiquitinated proteins were purified by Co2+ metal affinity chromatography in 8M urea denaturing conditions .
His - ubiquitinated K-Ras was subsequently purified with anti - Flag resin .
Following purification , mono @- and di @- ubiquitinated K-Ras appeared to be the major ubiquitination forms , which is consistent with the endogenous K-Ras ubiquitination pattern ( Fig. 1 , A and B ) .
H-Ras ubiquitination sites were also determined by the same approach .
Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic fragments from the bands migrating at the positions expected for mono @- and di @- ubiquitinated Ras revealed ubiquitination at Lys residues 104 and 147 of K-Ras , and Lys residues 117 , 147 and 170 for H-Ras ( fig. S1C ) .
The tryptic peptide with ubiquitination at Lys147 ( K147 ) was the most frequently observed peptide for both K-Ras and H-Ras , while Lys117 appeared as a secondary major ubiquitination site in H-Ras .

A New Dimension to Ras Function : A Novel Role for Nucleotide @-@ Free Ras in Class II Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Beta ( PI3KC2β ) Regulation ( PMC3441633 )
Ras , like all GTPases , cycles between an inactive GDP @-@ bound state and an active GTP @-@ bound state .
The transition from the inactive to active state requires formation of nucleotide @-@ free Ras through the action of exchange factors .
This state is considered to be a short @-@ lived transition state intermediate in vivo [ 36 ] based on the relatively high GTP : GDP ratio in vivo [ 37 ] , the ability of GTP to dissociate the GEF @-@ Ras complex in vitro [ 31 ] , and the assumption that there are no proteins in vivo that might stabilize nucleotide @-@ free Ras and prevent GTP loading .
However , our results provide the first direct evidence for a protein that may stabilize nucleotide @-@ free Ras in vivo .
We demonstrate that the RBD of PI3KC2β binds nucleotide @-@ free Ras in vitro ( Fig. 5 ) .
In contrast to the GEF @-@ Ras complex , which is disrupted by addition of guanine nucleotides , the PI3KC2β RBD @-@ Ras complex is stable even in the presence of high concentrations of GTP or GDP .
These data suggest that PI3KC2β binding to nucleotide @-@ free Ras in vivo may prevent loading of nucleotides onto Ras .
Although current methods do not allow for detection of nucleotide @-@ free GTPases in vivo , our BiFC results provide additional support for our model .
PI3KC2β preferentially interacts with Ras17N , which has a 30 @-@ fold lower affinity for nucleotide compared to wild type Ras and therefore should exist for longer periods in the nucleotide @-@ free state .
As a result , BiFC traps this form of Ras resulting in greater fluorescence complementation for Ras17N ( and Ras17N @/@ 69N ) compared to wild type or constitutively activated Ras ( 61L or 12V ) .
Phosphorylation of ASPP2 by RAS @/@ MAPK Pathway Is Critical for Its Full Pro @-@ Apoptotic Function ( PMC3847091 )
A synthetic peptide encoding amino acids 824 @-@ 832 , with a phosphoserine at residue 827 , was used to raise antibodies .
A polyclonal antibody NGH.S4 was purified by affinity column purification .
To test the efficacy of the purified phospho @-@ specific
antibody , a non @-@ radioactive in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed on the purified GST @-@ ASPP2 fragment ( 693 @-@ 1128 ) with recombinant MAPK1 .
Figure 1C shows that the phosphospecific antibody is specific for the ASPP2 fragment phosphorylated in vitro by MAPK .
To test whether endogenous ASPP2 could be phosphorylated in cells , Saos2 cells were grown in low serum for 50 hours to remove all background stimulation of RAS , after which the cells were stimulated with EGF and 20 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) .
Phosphorylated endogenous ASPP2 was detected by the phospho @-@ specific antibody 30 minutes after RAS stimulation ( Figure 1D ) .
ASPP2 phosphorylation was rapid and transient as 3 hours after EGF stimulation phosphorylated ASPP2 was barely detectable .
Moreover , with another different phospho @-@ ASPP2 antibody , ES1 , ASPP2 phosphorylation was also observed in a human colon cancer cell line HKe3 ER : HRASV12 cells , in which RAS activation is induced upon the addition of 4 @-@ hydroxytamoxifen ( 4 @-@ OHT ) [ 2,10,11 ] ( Figure 1E ) .
The phospho @-@ specific antibody for ASPP2 is specific as knockdown of ASPP2 resulted in a lack of detection of phospho @-@ ASPP2 .
All these demonstrate that ASPP2 is a novel substrate of MAPK and Ser827 of ASPP2 can be phosphorylated by RAS @/@ MAPK pathway .
Results
The S @/@ E @/@ E8 complex exists under physiological conditions
In previous studies , we showed that Sos-1 , E3b1 , and Eps8 could form a trimeric complex in vivo upon concomitant overexpression of the three proteins .
However , we failed to detect the existence of an endogenous S @/@ E @/@ E8 complex ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ) .
We reasoned that this could be due to the low efficiency of the immunoprecipitating antibodies used .
We thus sought to exploit the availability of eps8 @<sup> −/− </sup> fibroblasts to circumvent this problem .
To this end , we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using eps8 @<sup> −/− </sup> fibroblasts in which the expression of Eps8 was restored , to physiological levels , with an expression vector encoding a myc epitope @-@ tagged Eps8 ( −/− [ Eps8 myc ] cells ) .
We selected transfected clones in which the levels of expression of Eps8 myc were very similar to those present in wild-type fibroblasts ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Fig. 1 </xref> A ) .
Endogenous Sos-1 and E3b1 could be detected in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8 myc @-@ reconstituted , but not from eps8 @<sup> −/− </sup> fibroblasts ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Fig. 1 </xref> B ) .
To determine whether E3b1 mediates the interaction between Eps8 and Sos-1 , as it would be expected according to the tricomplex model , we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments under conditions in which the association between Eps8 and E3b1 was disrupted .
The binding site of E3b1 to the SH3 domain of Eps8 was previously mapped to the amino acid sequence , PPPPPVDYTEDEE , where the D and the Y residues are critical for efficient binding ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"> Mongiovi et al. , 1999 </xref> ) .
Thus , a peptide encompassing this region should specifically disrupt the Eps8 @–@ E3b1 association .
Indeed , no E3b1 could be recovered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8 myc @-@ reconstituted cells , when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of an excess of the competing peptide .
The association was , however , preserved when a control peptide , bearing a Y→A substitution and unable to bind to Eps8 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"> Mongiovi et al. , 1999 </xref> ) , was used ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Fig. 1 </xref> C ) .
Similarly , no Sos-1 could be recovered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates in the presence of the competing , but not of the control , peptide ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Fig. 1 </xref> C ) .
Thus , under physiological conditions , the coimmunoprecipitation of Eps8 and Sos-1 depends on the integrity of the Eps8 @–@ E3b1 interaction , pointing to the existence of a physiological S @/@ E @/@ E8 complex .
It can not be formally excluded that Eps8 , E3b1 , and Sos-1 associate after cell lysis , thus allowing coimmunoprecipitation .
However , we have previously demonstrated ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"> Scita et al. , 2001 </xref> ) that the three endogenous proteins also colocalize in vivo in dynamic actin structures .
Thus , the sum of our results strongly argues in favor of the existence of a physiological S @/@ E @/@ E8 complex .
Similarly , it can not be formally excluded that other interactors of the SH3 domain of Eps8 , besides E3b1 , mediate the formation of the endogenous trimeric complex .
This is , however , unlikely since no coimmunoprecipitation between Eps8 and Sos-1 could be detected when the two proteins were overexpressed in cell lines with relative low levels of E3b1 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ; unpublished data ) .
Moreover , neither RN @-@ tre , nor JIK , two other known interactors of the SH3 domain of Eps8 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"> Biesova et al. , 1997 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"> Mongiovi et al. , 1999 </xref> ) , were able to bind to Sos-1 ( unpublished data ) .
The adaptor molecules , E3b1 and Grb2 , compete for binding to Sos-1 both in vitro and in vivo
Sos-1 has been shown to be part of a signaling complex with Grb2 , which mediates the activation of Ras upon RTK stimulation .
Our finding that , under physiological conditions , Sos-1 also participates in a complex with Eps8 and E3b1 raises the question of the physical and functional relationships between these two Sos-1 @–@ containing complexes .
To gain insight into this issue , we initially mapped the region of E3b1 responsible for the interaction with Sos-1 by using a series of deletion mutants of E3b1 fused to glutathione <i> S </i>@ -@ transferase ( GST ) .
Native Sos-1 could be efficiently recovered onto GST @-@ E3b1 full length ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Fig. 2 </xref> A , amino acids [ aa ] 2 @–@ 480 ) .
Further mapping revealed that the SH3 domain of E3b1 ( aa 416 @–@ 480 ) was necessary and sufficient for binding ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Fig. 2 </xref> A ) .
We have previously shown that E3b1 binds to the proline @-@ rich , COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 ( aa 1131 @–@ 1333 ) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ) , which also binds to the SH3 of Grb2 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> Li et al. , 1993 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"> Cussac et al. , 1994 </xref> ) .
Thus , Grb2 and E3b1 might compete for binding to Sos-1 .
This hypothesis was validated by a series of experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo .
We could demonstrate that <bold> ( </bold>@ a ) the SH3 of Grb2 , but not of Eps8 , efficiently competed with the SH3 of E3b1 for binding to the proline @-@ rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 in vitro ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Fig. 2 </xref> B ) ; ( b ) the Sos-1 peptide VPVPPPVPPRRR , known to constitute a Grb2 @-@ SH3 binding site ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> Li et al. , 1993 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"> Cussac et al. , 1994 </xref> ) , competed equally well the binding of the COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 to the SH3s of Grb2 or E3b1 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Fig. 2 </xref> C ) ; ( c ) the binding constants of the interaction between the proline rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 were very similar ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Fig. 2 </xref> D ) ; ( d ) overexpression of Grb2 abolished the ability of GST @-@ E3b1 to bind to native Sos-1 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Fig. 3 </xref> A ) ; and ( e ) overexpression of E3b1 significantly decreased the coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Fig. 3 </xref> B ) .
Thus , Sos-1 binds either E3b1 or Grb2 , in a mutually exclusive fashion , suggesting that two distinct pools of Sos-1 exist in the cells .
To test this possibility in vivo , we set out to perturb the equilibrium between the Sos-1 @–@ E3b1 ( S @/@ E ) and Sos-1 @–@ Grb2 ( S @/@ G ) complexes , by increasing the levels of E3b1 within the cell .
If the two complexes are functionally distinct , then the overexpression of E3b1 , by competing the S @/@ G interaction , should result in ( a ) reduced Sos-1 recruitment in vivo to active EGFR , ( b ) consequent reduction in Ras activation , as measured by reduced Ras @-@ GTP levels , ( c ) reduced activation of Ras @-@ dependent pathways , as measured by activation of MAPK , and finally ( d ) reduced proliferative response .
All of these predictions were confirmed experimentally ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Fig. 4 </xref> , A–C ) .
We note that our mapping data are at variance with those recently reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"> Fan and Goff ( 2000 ) </xref> , who concluded that , in vivo @<i> , </i> the interaction between Sos-1 and E3b1 @–@ Abi-1 is mediated by the NH @<sub> 2 </sub>@ -@ terminal portion of the latter .
Consistently , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"> Fan and Goff ( 2000 ) </xref> did not observe competition in vivo between Grb2 and E3b1 for binding to Sos-1 .
Although we can not exclude that the NH @<sub> 2 </sub>@ -@ terminal region of E3b1 @–@ Abi-1 participates in binding , in vivo @<i> , </i> we were not able to observe a high @-@ affinity binding surface in that region by in vitro binding experiments ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Fig. 2 </xref> A ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ) .
Conversely , under our conditions of analysis , the efficient competition of the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 for binding to the same Sos-1 peptide , coupled to the readily detectable biological competition , strongly suggests that the SH3 @-@ mediated contact is the major determinant of the interaction between Sos-1 and E3b1 .
E3b1 is a limiting factor in Rac activation
The competition between E3b1 and Grb2 for the same binding site on Sos-1 implies that an individual Sos-1 molecule can only be part of one GEF complex at a time .
However , different pools of Sos-1 , either bound to Grb2 or to E3b1 , could exist in vivo .
We tried to gain insight into this issue .
We showed that BIAcore measurements revealed similar kinetic parameters for the SH3 @-@ mediated S @/@ G and S @/@ E interactions ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Fig. 2 </xref> D ) .
However , when we measured the relative abundance of S @/@ G and S @/@ E complexes within the cell , we found a 10 @-@ fold excess of the former ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Fig. 5 </xref> A ) , under conditions in which quantitative immunoprecipitation of the adaptor molecules , Grb2 and E3b1 , was achieved ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Fig. 5 </xref> A ) .
Thus , the data indicate that two pools of Sos-1 , associated with different adaptors , exist simultaneously in the cell .
They further suggest that the pool of E3b1 , available for binding to Sos-1 , is reduced relative to that of Grb2 , and may be rate @-@ limiting .
Indeed , overexpression of E3b1 resulted in increased PAK65 activity , an indicator of Rac activation ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"> Manser et al. , 1994 </xref> ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Fig. 5 </xref> B ) , which was abrogated by a dominant negative Rac mutant ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Fig. 5 </xref> B ) .
On the other hand , overexpression of Sos-1 did not lead to increased PAK65 activity .
An additional corollary of this hypothesis is that the overexpression of E3b1 , by facilitating the formation of a trimeric complex with Eps8 and Sos-1 , should directly lead to activation of Rac .
To test this prediction E3b1 or a mutant of E3b1 ( E3b1 @-@ DY ) , bearing alanine substitutions of the DY residues critical for the interaction with Eps8 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"> Mongiovi et al. , 1999 </xref> ) , were used to infect wild-type and eps8 @<sup> −/− </sup> fibroblasts .
The levels of GTP @-@ bound Rac were then determined by in vitro binding assays using the immobilized CRIB domain of PAK65 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"> Manser et al. , 1994 </xref> ) .
E3b1 , but not the E3b1 mutant impaired in Eps8 binding , caused a readily detectable increase in Rac @-@ GTP levels in wild type , but not in eps8 @<sup> −/− </sup> fibroblasts ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Fig. 5 </xref> C ) .
Thus , the overexpression of E3b1 is sufficient to activate Rac and this effect is strictly dependent on Eps8 @<bold> . </bold>
The indispensability of E3b1 in the cascade of events leading to Rac activation and Rac @-@ dependent actin reorganization was further analyzed at the biological level .
We have previously shown that interference with E3b1 functions , by microinjection of anti @-@ E3b1 antibodies , inhibited PDGF @-@ induced ruffles ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. 1999 </xref> ) .
We also showed that in eps8 @<sup> −/− </sup> cells , ruffling induced by PDGF and activated Ras , but not by activated Rac , was inhibited .
Ruffling , however , could be restored upon reexpression of Eps8 , but not of an Eps8 mutant unable to bind to E3b1 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ) , suggesting that the Eps8 @–@ E3b1 @-@ based complex is implicated in the transmission of signal between Ras and Rac .
Thus , one might predict that a mutant of E3b1 unable to associate to Eps8 should function as a dominant negative on Ras @-@ induced Rac @-@ dependent ruffling .
To test this , we cotransfected the activated versions of either Ras or Rac , together with E3b1 or the E3b1DY mutant .
RasV12 @-@ induced , but not RacQL @-@ induced , ruffles were efficiently inhibited by the coexpression of E3b1DY , but not of E3b1 wild type ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Fig. 6 </xref> ) , supporting the contention that the ability of E3b1 to form a complex with Eps8 is required to transmit signals from Ras to Rac .
In conclusion , our data show that two pools of Sos-1 exist in the cell , coupled respectively to Grb2 or E3b1 .
In addition , the availability of E3b1 , but not of Sos-1 , is indispensable and rate limiting in the pathway leading to Rac activation .
The dual GEF activity of Sos-1 depends on its presence in distinct complexes
The existence of Sos-1 in two physically and functionally distinct pools suggests the hypothesis that its presence in a S @/@ G or a S @/@ E @/@ E8 complex could dictate its Ras @- or Rac @-@ specific GEF activities , respectively .
To explore this possibility , we used an in vitro assay that can score GEF activities in Sos-1 @–@ containing immunoprecipitates .
Cells were transfected with either Sos-1 alone ( SosTfx ) or a combination of S @/@ E @/@ E8 ( Triple Tfx ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 </xref> A ) .
When Sos-1 was immunoprecipitated from SosTfx , it displayed Ras @-@ GEF , but not Rac @-@ GEF , activity ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 </xref> B ) .
Of note , little E3b1 and no Eps8 could be detected in Sos-1 immunoprecipitates ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 </xref> A ) .
Conversely , Grb2 was readily recovered from the same immunoprecipitates ( unpublished data ) .
We then used the Triple Tfx and coimmunoprecipitated Sos-1 with anti @-@ Eps8 antibodies ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 , A and B </xref> ) .
Under these conditions , all of the coimmunoprecipitated Sos-1 is present in the S @/@ E @/@ E8 tricomplex ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ) .
Despite lower levels of Sos-1 in the coimmunoprecipitate ( with respect to a Sos-1 immunoprecipitate from SosTfx ) , Rac @-@ GEF activity was now present ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 </xref> B ) .
Conversely , no Ras @-@ GEF activity could be detected ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 </xref> B ) .
The lack of Ras @-@ GEF activity was not due to the low levels of Sos-1 .
To prove this point , we immunoprecipitated from SosTfx an amount of Sos-1 comparable to that present in anti @-@ Eps8 immunoprecipitates from Triple Tfx ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 , A and B </xref> , lanes SosTfx1 @/@ SosTfx10 ) .
Under these conditions , Ras @-@ GEF activity was readily detectable ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 </xref> B ) .
The detection of Rac @-@ specific GEF activity in anti @-@ Eps8 immunoprecipitates strictly required the presence of Sos-1 , since no GEF activity was detected in Eps8 immunoprecipitates , in the absence of coexpressed Sos-1 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ; unpublished data ) .
Furthermore , no Rac @-@ GEF activity could be detected in Eps8 immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells transfected with Sos-1 , E3b1 , and an Eps8 mutant that is impaired in its ability to bind E3b1 and thereby can not form a trimeric complex ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ) .
At this stage , we can not formally exclude that an unknown GEF , coprecipitating with Sos-1 , is responsible for the observed activity .
However , such a hypothetical protein should not only be associated with Sos-1 , but also be active only in the presence of Eps8 and E3b1 , which are both required for the formation of the trimeric complex endowed with Rac @-@ specific GEF activity ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Scita et al. , 1999 </xref> ) , making this possibility unlikely .
It is reasonable , therefore , to propose that Sos-1 alone ( or complexed with proteins , such as Grb2 ) is endowed with Ras @-@ GEF activity .
However , upon interaction with Eps8 and E3b1 , its specificity is switched toward Rac .
A common feature of proteins endowed with GEF catalytic activity is their ability to bind to their specific nucleotide @-@ depleted GTPase with relative high affinities .
Thus , one might postulate that Sos-1 associates with the nucleotide @-@ free form of Rac exclusively when engaged in the S @/@ E @/@ E8 complex .
Purified and nucleotide depleted , GST @-@ Rac and GST @-@ Cdc42 proteins were therefore used to test their ability to interact with Sos-1 .
Native Sos-1 , present in lysates of −/− [ Eps8 myc ] fibroblasts , could be specifically recovered with nucleotide @-@ depleted immobilized GST @-@ Rac , but not with GST @-@ Cdc42 or GST alone ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 </xref> C ) .
Conversely , no Sos-1 could be recovered with GST @-@ Rac from lysates of eps8 @<sup> −/− </sup> cells .
Thus , Eps8 is required for the association between Sos-1 and nucleotide @-@ free Rac .
Furthermore , under conditions in which the Eps8 @–@ E3b1 or the E3b1 @–@ Sos-1 interactions were disrupted by specifically competing peptides , a reduction of > 80 % in the amount of Sos-1 bound to nucleotide @-@ depleted Rac was observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Fig. 7 </xref> C ) .
This latter result strongly suggests that an intact S @/@ E @/@ E8 complex is required for binding to Rac , providing a molecular basis for the catalytic specificity of the complex .
RTK activation differentially regulates the S @/@ G and S @/@ E @/@ E8 complexes
Since S @/@ G and S @/@ E complexes are present in the cells simultaneously , then both Sos-1 @-@ dependent Ras @- and Rac @-@ GEF activities are present at the same time .
The question remains as to how these two complexes , and the ensuing Ras and Rac activities , are coordinated to achieve propagation of signals .
We therefore looked for evidence of differential regulation of the S @/@ G and S @/@ E complex upon RTK stimulation .
Upon PDGF stimulation , we observed decreased coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 and consequently between PDGFR and Sos-1 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> Fig. 8 , A and B </xref> ) , which correlated with the appearance of a mobility @-@ retarded form of Sos-1 .
This likely represents a hyperphosphorylated form of Sos-1 , as previously demonstrated ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"> Baltensperger et al. , 1993 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"> Cherniack et al. , 1994 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"> Pronk et al. , 1994 </xref> ) .
Conversely , under identical conditions , the coimmunoprecipitation between E3b1 and Sos-1 was not affected ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> Fig. 8 </xref> A ) .
Similarly , the stability of the endogenous trimeric complex , Sos-1 @/@ Eps8 @/@ E3b1 was not affected by treatment of cells with growth factors ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> Fig. 8 </xref> C ) .
The above data indicate that , as a consequence of activation of RTKs , the S @/@ G complex is disrupted , whereas the S @/@ E @/@ E8 complex persists in the cell .
This might lead to a transient peak in Ras activity vis a vis a more prolonged activation of Rac .
Therefore , we measured the kinetic of RTK @-@ induced activation of Ras and Rac .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> Fig. 8 </xref> D , activation of Ras was rapid and short lived , whereas activation of Rac was sustained over a longer period of time , compatible with the differential regulation of the corresponding activating complexes , S @/@ G and S @/@ E @/@ E8 .

Dual blockade of EGFR and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation potentiates growth inhibition of breast cancer cells ( PMID : 15280923 )
<sec-title level="1"> RESULTS </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Differences in activity of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in the breast cancer cell lines </sec-title>
Immunoblotting revealed differences in basal levels of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in different breast cancer cell lines , while the expression of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 protein , normalised to actin expression , was relatively consistent ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1A </xref> ) .
To test whether the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activity was only a tissue culture phenomenon , selected cell lines were injected into the mammary fatpads of nude mice , and protein lysates were prepared from the tumours .
Taking into account the fact that lysates were of a mixture of tumour cells and surrounding stromal and infiltrating host cells , the immunoblotting of the tumour @-@ derived proteins showed similar results to those obtained using lysates of cultured cells .
MDA @-@ MB-231 and MDA @-@ MB-435 tumour lysates showed high levels of p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 in comparison to MDA @-@ MB-468 and GI101A tumours ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1B </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Elevated ERK activity does not necessarily correlate with the status of EGFR and HER2 in breast cancer cells </sec-title>
Since ERK1 @/@ ERK2 can be activated via EGFR and HER2 signalling , relative expression levels of these growth factor receptors were measured in the panel of cell lines , to test if there was a correlation between ERK activation and receptor expression levels .
As expected from the heterogeneity seen in clinical specimens of breast cancer , there was variability in expression of EGFR , from high expression in MDA @-@ MB-468 and minimal expression in MDA @-@ MB-435 cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1A </xref> ) .
Comparing these results with the level of pERK1 @/@ pERK2 indicated that there was no direct correlation between levels of these growth factor receptors and basal levels of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation .
Thus , while the MDA @-@ MB-231 cell line with highly activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 expressed a relatively high level of EGFR , other combinations occur .
High pERK1 @/@ pERK2 levels were detected in MDA @-@ MB-435 cells , which have very little EGFR , in contrast to the SUM149 cells with high EGFR expression and low ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activity .
Similarly , no correlation was found between the expression of HER2 receptor and the status of pERK ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1A </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> PKI166 inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation </sec-title>
Six cell lines with different levels of EGFR expression were selected for treatment with PKI166 .
Initial studies used a dose range of 0.1 @–@ 5.0 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> ( data not shown ) , and the results of treating cells with 0.5 and 5.0 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref>@ .
Growth inhibition was determined from the results of MTT assays , comparing PKI166 treated cells with cells exposed to medium with 0.1 % DMSO .
Treatment with 0.5 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> PKI166 , a concentration less than plasma and tumour concentrations achieved in preclinical models from oral administration of the drug , and the higher dose of 5.0 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> , produced different levels of growth inhibition in different cell lines .
As expected , cells expressing low levels of EGFR and HER2 , GI101A , MDA @-@ MB-435 showed least growth inhibition .
However , not all of the high EGFR @-@ expressing lines were sensitive to PKI166 .
The lower dose produced 46 and 21 % growth inhibition of SUM149 and MDA @-@ MB-468 cells , respectively , but had little effect ( 3.3 % inhibition ) on the growth of MDA @-@ MB-231 cells .
The SKBR3 cells , expressing EGFR and also high levels of HER2 , were most sensitive , showing 55 % growth inhibition with 0.5 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> and 76 % inhibition with 5.0 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> PKI166 .
<sec-title level="2"> PKI166 inhibits phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 in breast cancer cells </sec-title>
To demonstrate inhibition of EGFR and HER2 phosphorylation by the concentrations of PKI166 used for the growth inhibition assays , cell lysates were prepared from MDA @-@ MB-231 , MDA @-@ MB-468 , SUM149 and SKBR3 cells after treatment with PKI166 and stimulation with EGF , and phosphorylation of the receptors assessed .
PKI166 inhibited ligand @-@ induced EGFR phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner in these four cell lines , and also phosphorylation of HER2 in SKBR3 cells , in the absence or presence of 50 ng ml @<sup> −1 </sup> EGF ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref> ) ( data for other cell lines not shown ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Constitutive ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation as a potential escape mechanism from inhibition by PKI166 </sec-title>
Inhibition of growth by PKI166 was most effective in cells with high levels of EGFR and nonactivated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( SUM149 , MDA @-@ MB-468 ) when compared with cells with high EGFR and high basal level of phosphorylated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( MDA @-@ MB-231 ) .
To test whether the basal ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activity was providing an escape mechanism from inhibition by PKI166 , cells were treated with a combination of PKI166 and UO126 , an inhibitor of MEK ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ) .
GI101A cells , with low EGFR and nonactivated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , showed modest growth inhibition when treated with an individual inhibitor and no significant difference with the combination of the two .
MDA @-@ MB-435 cells were significantly inhibited by U0126 alone , and the addition of PKI166 made no difference .
The combination of agents significantly increased the antiproliferative action of PKI166 at the 0.5 and 5.0 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> doses in cells expressing higher levels of EGFR or HER2 ( SUM149 , MDA @-@ MB-468 , SKBR3 ) , including MDA @-@ MB-231 cells .
Treating the MDA @-@ MB-231 cells with U0126 alone produced 8.5 % inhibition , which was not significantly different from control values .
The addition of U0126 to 0.5 or 5.0 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> PKI166 significantly increased the growth inhibition produced by the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ) .
Apoptosis induced by PKI166 and U0126 was assessed by measuring DNA fragmentation by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis , and determining the proportions of hypodiploid cells .
This showed that PKI166 alone or in combination with U0126 induced apoptosis in the EGFR or HER2 expressing cell lines MDA @-@ MB-231 , MDA @-@ MB-468 , SKBR3 and SUM149 cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref> ) , although the proportions of hypodiploid cells varied between the different lines .
Similar to the MTT results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> , SKBR3 and SUM 149 cells were most sensitive to treatment with the inhibitors , while the proportions of hypodiploid MDA @-@ MB-231 cells were lower .
Treatment with U0126 alone significantly increased the numbers of MDA @-@ MB-231 in the G @<sub> 1 </sub> phase of the cell cycle ( 89 @–@ 93 % compared with 70 @–@ 72 % of control or PKI 166 treated cells , <i> P </i> < 0.001 ) .
The proportion of SUM149 cells in G @<sub> 1 </sub> was significantly increased by treatment with either inhibitor alone and the combination , while apoptosis was significantly increased in cells exposed to PKI166 , with or without U0126 .
Induction of the cyclin @-@ dependent kinase inhibitor p27 @<sup> KIP1 </sup> generally corresponded with increases in the proportion of cells in G @<sub> 1 </sub> , as shown for MDA @-@ MB-231 and SUM149 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Differential effect of PKI166 on ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation </sec-title>
To evaluate whether the antiproliferative effects of EGFR inhibition involve ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation , the status of pERK1 @/@ pERK2 was determined in cells exposed to the same concentrations of PKI166 used for the growth inhibition assays , in the presence and absence of U0126 ( 10 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref> ) .
U1026 alone inhibited ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in MDA @-@ MB-435 cells , with PKI 166 having no effect , as expected from minimal expression of EGFR in these cells .
PKI166 inhibited ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in SUM149 cells , as did U0126 alone , and further inhibition by the combination of drugs was barely discernible .
Treatment of MDA @-@ MB-468 with either drug resulted in similar inhibition of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation , with almost complete elimination of phosphorylated proteins by the combination .
PKI166 alone minimally altered the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 status in the MDA @-@ MB-231 cells , and U0126 produced some inhibition , while the combination resulted in a substantial reduction , reflecting the effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis .
For SUM149 and MDA @-@ MB-468 cells the combination of the inhibitors almost completely eliminated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation after 1 h incubation , although growth inhibition over 72 h was 54 @–@ 63 % with 0.5 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> PKI166 plus 10 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> U0126 , and 63 @–@ 81 % with 5.0 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> PKI166 plus 10 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> U0126 ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ) .
Recovery of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in the U0126 @-@ treated cells over the period of the growth inhibition assays was not investigated , but the data may also suggest that other signal pathways were contributing to the growth and survival of the cells .
The effects of the inhibitors were not related to downregulation of total ERK1 @/@ ERK2 proteins , as the levels did not decrease with treatment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref> ) .
A Signaling Pathway Involving TGF-β2 and Snail in Hair Follicle Morphogenesis ( PMID : 15630473 )
In a common theme of organogenesis , certain cells within a multipotent epithelial sheet exchange signals with their neighbors and develop into a bud structure .
Using hair bud morphogenesis as a paradigm , we employed mutant mouse models and cultured keratinocytes to dissect the contributions of multiple extracellular cues in orchestrating adhesion dynamics and proliferation to shape the cluster of cells involved .
We found that transforming growth factor β2 signaling is necessary to transiently induce the transcription factor Snail and activate the Ras @-@ mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway in the bud .
In the epidermis , <i> Snail </i> misexpression leads to hyperproliferation and a reduction in intercellular adhesion .
When <i> E-cadherin </i> is transcriptionally down-regulated , associated adhesion proteins with dual functions in signaling are released from cell @-@ cell contacts , a process which we demonstrate leads to Ras @-@ MAPK activation .
These studies provide insights into how multipotent cells within a sheet are stimulated to undergo transcriptional changes that result in proliferation , junctional remodeling , and bud formation .
This novel signaling pathway further weaves together the web of different morphogens and downstream transcriptional events that guide hair bud formation within the developing skin .
The study of hair follicle morphogenesis provides insights into how cells within a sheet can be triggered to proliferate , remodel , and form buds - a recurring theme in development
Introduction
Mammalian development involves the morphogenesis of complex three @-@ dimensional structures from seemingly uniform sheets or masses of cells .
A simple bud @-@ like structure initiates the formation of many organs , including lungs , spinal cord , mammary glands , and hair follicles [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b01"> 1 </xref>@ ] .
The multipotent , adhering epithelial cells are typically attached to an underlying basal lamina that polarizes the epithelial sheet and separates it from surrounding mesenchyme .
Budding morphogenesis is guided by a reciprocal exchange of signals between epithelium and mesenchyme to specify the identity of the organ that will form and to govern its growth .
At the helm of these molecular communication pathways are Wnts , bone morphogenic proteins ( BMPs ) , transforming growth factor βs ( TGF-βs ) , and fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) .
Through activation of cell surface transmembrane receptors , these external signaling molecules trigger distinct cascades of intracellular events that culminate in changes in gene expression , growth , and differentiation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b02"> 2 </xref>@ ] .
How this constellation of signals collaborates in tailoring each budding process so that it executes a distinct morphogenetic program has yet to be comprehensively defined .
However , the process appears to be patterned at the initial stages of bud formation , since the relative importance of these pathways and their downstream effectors differ as buds begin to develop and cell fates are specified .
The development of a bud requires a number of coordinated changes in the behavior of the targeted cells within an epithelial sheet .
The process must be accompanied by alterations in the proliferation , polarity , shape , and adhesiveness of selected cells , as well as by modifications in their underlying basal lamina .
Thus , extracellular epithelial @-@ mesenchymal crosstalk must be intricately orchestrated to couple the determination of distinct cell fates with the contemporaneous remodeling of the physical and structural properties of the cell .
Among the few dispensable organs , hair follicles offer an excellent model system to study epithelial bud formation .
Mammalian skin epithelium begins as a single sheet of multipotent ectodermal cells .
During development , specialized mesenchymal cells populate the skin in a spatially defined pattern to initiate the complex epithelial @-@ mesenchymal crosstalk that will specify the bud [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b03"> 3 </xref>@ ] .
Once committed , a small cluster of epithelial cells , the placode , instructs a group of underlying mesenchymal cells to condense and form the nascent dermal papilla , which will be a permanent fixture of the hair follicle .
Subsequent exchanges between the placode and nascent dermal papilla result in further growth of the follicle into the underlying dermis , or down @-@ growth , and eventual differentiation into the six concentric layers of the mature follicle .
Previously , we delineated how two respective epithelial and mesenchymal signals , Wnts and the BMP @-@ inhibitory factor noggin , function in concert to induce lymphoid enhancer factor-1 @/@ β-catenin ( LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin ) - mediated gene transcription within the follicle placode [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] .
The downstream changes elicited through convergence of these two early signaling pathways include down-regulation of the gene encoding E-cadherin , the prototypical epithelial cadherin that forms the transmembrane core of intercellular adherens junctions ( AJs ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b05"> 5 </xref>@ ] .
We subsequently showed that when E-cadherin is transgenically elevated in mouse skin , hair follicle morphogenesis is blocked , suggesting that E-cadherin down-regulation is a critical event in governing the adhesion dynamics necessary for budding morphogenesis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] .
Like LEF-1 , E-cadherin also binds to β-catenin .
At sites of cell @-@ cell contact , however , E-cadherin-β-catenin complexes recruit α-catenin , which in turn coordinates the associated actin polymerization dynamics necessary to stabilize nascent AJs and integrate the cytoskeleton across an epithelial sheet [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b06"> 6 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b07"> 7 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b08"> 8 </xref>@ ] .
α-Catenin also binds to the class III Lin-1 , Isl-1 , Mec-3 ( LIM ) protein Ajuba ( a member of the zyxin family of proteins ) , which appears to function dually in both adhesion and in activation of the Ras @-@ mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b09"> 9 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b10"> 10 </xref>@ ] .
Through these links , AJs appear able to couple adhesion with cytoskeletal dynamics as well as with nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling .
This provides a framework for conceptualizing why E-cadherin levels appear to impact upon a plethora of developmental processes ( reviewed in [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b11"> 11 </xref>@ ] ) .
As we probed more deeply into the underlying mechanisms governing <i> E-cadherin </i> promoter activity , we were intrigued by the close proximity of the LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin binding site to a site known to bind the Snail @/@ Slug family of zinc finger transcriptional repressor proteins [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12"> 12 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b13"> 13 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b14"> 14 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b15"> 15 </xref>@ ] .
Both activity of Snail and down-regulation of E-cadherin play pivotal roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( EMTs ) , typified by the transformation of polarized , adhering epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b17"> 17 </xref>@ ] .
Bud formation differs from an EMT in that E-cadherin activity needs to be down-regulated but not prevented , so that adhesive junctions are remodeled rather than quantitatively impaired .
Supportive of an underlying ability to fine @-@ tune cadherin expression at the transcriptional level , Snail seems to have an additive effect with LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin in negatively modulating <i> E-cadherin </i> promoter activity [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] .
In the present study , we discovered that Snail is expressed briefly at an early stage of hair bud formation , when E-cadherin down-regulation and activation of proliferation take place .
Thereafter , Snail disappears and remains absent during subsequent follicle down @-@ growth and maturation .
This exquisite pattern appears to be functionally relevant since altering it in vivo correspondingly affects features associated with hair bud formation , including down-regulation of E-cadherin , increased proliferation , and repressed terminal differentiation .
Although the temporal spike of Snail in the hair bud is reflected at the mRNA level and seems to follow Wnt signaling and BMP inhibition , LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin activation does not appear to induce <i> Snail </i> gene expression in embryonic skin keratinocytes .
In contrast , we provide in vitro , transgenic ( Tg ) , and gene targeting evidence to show that TGF-β2 and small phenotype @– and mothers against decapentaplegic @–@ related protein 2 ( SMAD2 ) signaling are upstream inducers of <i> Snail </i> gene expression in skin epithelium .
In the absence of TGF-β2 signaling and <i> Snail </i> gene expression , hair placodes can form , but further follicle down @-@ growth is blocked .
Our studies point to the view that Snail likely functions downstream of cell fate specification , at a stage where the bud begins to exhibit enhanced proliferation and migration .
Results
<i> Snail </i> mRNA and Protein Are Expressed Transiently at the Hair Bud Stage of Follicle Morphogenesis
Although Snail family members are most frequently associated with EMTs , they also participate in many malignant processes involving a down-regulation but not a quantitative abrogation of intercellular junctions [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b18"> 18 </xref>@ ] .
The range of developmental processes in which Snail family members have been implicated thus includes the type of epithelial remodeling that is observed in hair follicle bud formation .
Given our prior observation that exogenously added Snail can participate with LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin in down @-@ regulating <i> E-cadherin </i> expression in keratinocytes [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] , coupled with the established requirement for LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin in hair follicle morphogenesis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b19"> 19 </xref>@ ] , we turned to addressing whether Snail @/@ Slug family members might also participate in the process .
PCR analyses identified transient <i> Snail </i> mRNA expression during a period of skin embryogenesis when waves of hair follicles are forming ( unpublished data ) .
To pinpoint specifically where <i> Snail </i> mRNA is expressed in the developing skin , we conducted in situ hybridization using a cRNA probe unique to the <i> Snail </i> 3′ untranslated region ( UTR ) .
Embryonic day 17.5 ( E17.5 ) was chosen , since the multiple waves of follicle morphogenesis occurring at this time enabled us to evaluate Snail expression at different stages of the process .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ A , specific hybridization was detected within the epithelium of nascent hair buds .
By contrast , as follicles progressed further through their development ( e.g. , germ and peg stages ) , they exhibited no signs of hybridization ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ A ) .
The transient nature of <i> Snail </i> mRNA expression during follicle development was most apparent in hybridized skin sections containing follicles from two different waves of morphogenesis ( as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref> ) .
Hybridizing hair buds from a later wave appeared juxtaposed with nonhybridizing follicles from an earlier wave .
To determine whether this transient nature of <i> Snail </i> mRNA expression is reflected at the protein level , we generated an antibody against the N-terminal sequence that resides upstream of the more conserved zinc finger domains .
As judged by Western blot analysis , the antibody did not detect endogenous proteins from cultured keratinocytes , but it did yield a band of the expected size from keratinocytes transiently expressing a hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged Snail protein ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ B ) .
The antibody also recognized a band corresponding to the size of endogenous Snail ( approximately 28 kDa ) in lysates from embryonic mouse skin , the temporal appearance of which corresponded to the waves of hair follicle morphogenesis from E15.5 to newborn when over 90 % of the hair on the mouse is formed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ B ) .
Consistent with the Western blot data , immunohistochemical analysis did not detect Snail in single @-@ layered E13.5 epidermis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ C ) nor in the placode , which is the earliest morphological sign of the commitment of multipotent cells of the embryonic ectoderm to a hair cell fate ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ D ) .
Consistent with the in situ hybridization results , anti @-@ Snail antibody labeled only hair buds and not follicles at more mature stages of development ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ E ) .
Taken together , the anti @-@ Snail antibody appeared to be specific for its target protein .
It did not detect other Snail family members known to be expressed in keratinocytes and @/@ or skin ( unpublished data ) .
Furthermore , the immunohistochemical data paralleled our <i> Snail </i> in situ hybridization data revealing transient <i> Snail </i> expression at the hair bud stage ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ A ) .
As judged by immunohistochemistry , Snail protein was localized to the nuclei of the hair bud cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ E ) .
This feature was consistent with Snail 's known function as a transcriptional repressor [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12"> 12 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b13"> 13 </xref>@ ] .
Additionally , anti @-@ Snail labeling was detected in only three of the four major waves of follicle morphogenesis .
Snail was not found in the buds of guard hairs that are the earliest of all hairs to form ( at E13.5 ) , and which constitute less than 5 % of the mouse coat ( unpublished data ) .
As judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen Ki67 , the timing of Snail expression coincided with the stage at which the developing follicle enhanced its proliferation and down @-@ growth ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ F ) .
Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the active ( phosphorylated ) form of MAPK ( pMAPK ) marked a subset of the proliferating ( Ki67 @-@ positive ) cells , and pMAPK @-@ positive cells were enriched in the hair bud ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ G ) .
The timing of Snail induction and Ki67 and pMAPK enrichment in the hair bud appeared to follow closely the induction of LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin activity , known to initiate in the hair placode stage [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
However , like placodes , hair buds exhibited down-regulation in E-cadherin expression ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ H ; see also [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] ) .
Sustained Expression of Snail Results in Epidermal Hyperproliferation and Differentiation Defects in Tg Mouse Skin
The striking spike of Snail expression coincident with hair bud formation and enhanced proliferation prompted us to examine the consequences of ectopically expressing Snail elsewhere in mouse skin epidermis .
To distinguish Tg from endogenous Snail , we used the HA @-@ epitope , shown previously not to alter Snail 's transcriptional activity [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12"> 12 </xref>@ ] .
Of 20 <i> K14 @-@ Snail [ HA ] </i> Tg animals generated , three expressed the transgene and all exhibited analogous phenotypes .
Mice that integrated the transgene at the single @-@ cell stage died at or shortly after birth .
The three surviving full @-@ Tg founder mice harbored transgene integrations that gave stable transmission of mosaic <i> Snail </i> gene expression through the germline .
Progressively poor health necessitated our sacrificing most offspring from these lines within a year of birth .
As <i> Snail </i> Tg animals grew , they became distinguished by their small size , short tails , and flaky skin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figure 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Histological analyses of 3-d old ( P3 ) mice revealed mosaic patches marked by epidermal thickening ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figure 2 </xref>@ B ) .
The mosaic morphology was reflected at the level of Tg Snail protein , with only the hyperthickened regions expressing nuclear HA @-@ tagged Snail ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figure 2 </xref>@ C ) .
These hyperthickened areas were marked by excessive proliferation , as revealed by antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen Ki67 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figure 2 </xref>@ D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> 2 </xref>@ E ) .
Activated , pMAPK @-@ positive cells were also prevalent in these areas ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figure 2 </xref>@ F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> 2 </xref>@ G ) , as were cells expressing keratin 6 , a keratin induced in the suprabasal layers of hyperproliferative skin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figure 2 </xref>@ H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> 2 </xref>@ I ) .
Expression of the <i> Snail </i> transgene did not block terminal differentiation in the hyperproliferative epidermis , but it distorted it markedly ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> Figure 3 </xref>@ A– @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> 3 </xref>@ H ) .
Typical of most hyperproliferating conditions , Snail expression led to a large expansion in layers with spinous and granular morphology .
Additionally , however , was a marked and variable expansion of keratin 5 ( K5 ) , normally restricted to the innermost basal layer ( see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> Figure 3 </xref> ) .
Although the failure of <i> Snail </i>@ -@ null mice to develop past gastrulation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b21"> 21 </xref>@ ] precluded our ability to study the loss of Snail function in skin development , a good correlation emerged between the expression of Snail protein and the extension of K5 , Ki67 , and pMAPK suprabasally ( compare data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figures 2 </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> 3 </xref> ) .
The changes in hyperproliferation and differentiation were not initially accompanied by gross signs of epithelial invaginations .
With age , however , epidermal folds and undulations developed in areas where Snail was expressed , and proliferative markers persisted in these regions ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> Figure 3 </xref>@ I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> 3 </xref>@ J ; anti-cyclin D staining ) .
The undulations were accompanied by partial dissolution of the underlying basement membrane ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> Figure 3 </xref>@ K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> 3 </xref>@ L ) .
Aberrant staining was also observed with antibodies against components of the hemidesmosomes , which provide strong adhesion of basal epidermal cells to the underlying basal lamina ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> Figure 3 </xref>@ M and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g003"> 3 </xref>@ N ) .
Interestingly , similar types of alterations occur in the basement membrane in the hair bud of embryonic and newborn mice when Snail is normally expressed .
The fact that the basement membrane separating the epidermis from the dermis is altered only in the adult Tg animals suggests the involvement of intermediary factors not as readily available in the epidermis as they are in the follicle .

Given that the <i> E-cadherin </i> promoter is a direct target for Snail @-@ mediated repression in vitro [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12"> 12 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b13"> 13 </xref>@ ] , and that E-cadherin was down-regulated in Snail @-@ expressing hair buds , we examined the status of E-cadherin and other AJ proteins within regions of hyperproliferative epidermis where Tg Snail was present ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ A ) .
In these regions , immunofluorescence staining of E-cadherin and α-catenin were markedly diminished .
In contrast , the intensity of antibody staining for two other AJ proteins , β-catenin and Ajuba , was still strong .
Interestingly , however , despite appreciable immunofluorescence , localization of β-catenin and Ajuba appeared to be largely cytoplasmic rather than at cell @-@ cell borders ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ A insets ) .
Architectural differences in the epidermis made Western blot analyses somewhat difficult to gauge .
However , in regions such as ear skin , where the highest levels of Snail protein were expressed , the effects were accentuated .
In both back skin and ear skin , overall levels of E-cadherin and α-catenin were reduced , under conditions where β-catenin and Ajuba levels remained unchanged relative to controls ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ B ) .
Taken together , these data were consistent with our results obtained from immunofluorescence microscopy .
A priori , the decrease in α-catenin levels could be due to either direct transcriptional repression by Snail or perturbations in AJ formation caused by the decrease in <i> E-cadherin </i> gene expression .
To distinguish between these possibilities , we tested whether α-catenin levels could be restored by exogenous expression of <i> E-cadherin </i> in Snail @-@ expressing keratinocytes .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ C , transiently transfected keratinocytes expressing HA @-@ tagged Snail displayed a loss of E-cadherin and α-catenin at cell @-@ cell borders .
Coexpression of exogenous HA @-@ tagged E-cadherin not only enabled cell @-@ cell border localization of E-cadherin protein , but also rescued the cell @-@ cell border staining of α-catenin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ C ) .
The ability to restore α-catenin expression and localization under these conditions argues against the notion that Snail transcriptionally represses <i> α-catenin . </i>
Rather , the findings are consistent with a previous report that E-cadherin is required for the translation of <i> α-catenin </i> mRNA [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b22"> 22 </xref>@ ] .
Despite the reductions in AJ markers , Tg skin still displayed sealed membranes and intercellular junctions that were largely intact , as judged by ultrastructural analyses ( unpublished data ) .
In this respect , the skin epithelium resembled that of the hair bud , where the down-regulation in junction proteins is permissive for cell @-@ cell remodeling without abrogating intercellular adhesion .
The similarities between <i> Snail </i> Tg epidermis and hair buds extended to the hyperproliferative state , leading us to wonder whether the down-regulation of AJ proteins might contribute to this condition .
Given the increase in pMAPK staining in <i> Snail </i> Tg epidermis ( see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figure 2 </xref>@ G ) , we used pMAPK levels as our assay to test whether the loss of E-cadherin contributed to the Snail @-@ mediated increase in proliferation .
Consistent with our in vivo observations , transfected keratinocytes expressing Snail exhibited a substantial increase in pMAPK levels relative to control cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ D ) .
Coexpression of E-cadherin with Snail appeared to abrogate this effect .
Together , these findings raised the possibility that an AJ @-@ associated protein that is normally sequestered at the plasma membrane may participate in a proliferation signaling pathway when AJs are deconstructed .
Numerous studies have correlated a down-regulation of E-cadherin with a translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus and a transactivation of genes that are regulated by the LEF-1 @/@ T cell factor ( TCF ) family of DNA binding proteins [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b24"> 24 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b25"> 25 </xref>@ ] .
The presence of nuclear cyclin D in hyperproliferative <i> Snail </i> Tg epidermis was particularly intriguing since prior studies have reported <i> cyclin D </i> gene as a direct target of TCF @/@ β-catenin transcription [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b26"> 26 </xref>@ ] .
This said , we did not detect nuclear β-catenin in our Tg epidermis , and mating the Snail Tg mice against the TOPGal reporter mouse [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b20"> 20 </xref>@ ] gave no signs of ectopic LEF-1 @/@ Tcf @/@ β-catenin activity ( unpublished data ) .
We next turned to the presence of cytoplasmic Ajuba for a possible mechanistic link to the proliferative increase in our <i> Snail </i> Tg epidermis .
In addition to its documented ability to bind α-catenin [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b10"> 10 </xref>@ ] , Ajuba can also associate with growth factor receptor @-@ bound protein-2 ( Grb-2 ) / son of sevenless ( Sos ) , the nucleotide exchange factor for Ras , which is upstream from activation of MAPK [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b09"> 9 </xref>@ ] .
Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Tg skin , we examined the possibility that Ajuba might have changed its binding partner in Snail @-@ expressing epidermis .
Interestingly , Ajuba was readily detected in anti @-@ Grb-2 immunoprecipitates of protein lysates from skins of <i> Snail </i> Tg mice but not from the corresponding wild-type ( WT ) animals ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ E ) .
When these experiments were repeated with <i> α-catenin </i>@ -@ null epidermis , a similar Grb-2 @-@ Ajuba association was detected , and again , this interaction was not detected in the protein extracts from control littermate skin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ E ) .
Together , these data demonstrate that the reduction in α-catenin levels , either by Snail @-@ mediated down-regulation of <i> E-cadherin </i> or by <i> α-catenin </i> conditional targeting , allows Ajuba to interact with Grb-2 @/@ Sos .
If the competition between Grb-2 @/@ Sos and α-catenin for Ajuba is functionally relevant to the hyperproliferative state of a keratinocyte , then overexpression of Ajuba would be expected to bypass the competition and promote activation of the Ras @-@ MAPK pathway in WT keratinocytes .
Indeed , when serum @-@ starved keratinocytes were transiently transfected with an Ajuba expression vector , the levels of pMAPK were not only elevated but also comparable to those transfected with the <i> K14 @-@ HASnail </i> transgene ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ F ) .
This activation was abolished when cells were treated with a small peptide inhibitor that specifically interrupts the Grb-2 @/@ Sos interaction ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ F ; see lanes marked “ inh ” ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b27"> 27 </xref>@ ] .
Ajuba 's pre @-@ LIM domain is the segment that associates with Grb-2 's Src @-@ homology 3 domain [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b09"> 9 </xref>@ ] .
When this domain was overexpressed in serum @-@ starved keratinocytes , a comparable elevation in pMAPK was observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g004"> Figure 4 </xref>@ F ) .
As expected , the small peptide inhibitor that interrupts the Grb-2 @/@ Sos association blocked the effects .
These data suggested that by elevating cytosolic Ajuba levels , Ajuba 's pre @-@ LIM domain may associate with Grb-2 @/@ Sos in a manner that stimulates its nucleotide exchange activity and leads to activation of the Ras @-@ MAPK pathway .
Although this pathway provides one mechanism by which Snail expression and proliferation may be coupled in skin epithelium , proliferative circuitries involving AJs are known to be complex and often interwoven .
Future studies will be needed to systematically dissect these putative intricacies at a molecular level .
Probing the Regulation of <i> Snail </i> Gene Expression Reveals an Essential Link to TGF-β2 Signaling in the Developing Hair Bud
The temporal spike of <i> Snail </i> mRNA expression in the hair bud prompted us to consider what factor ( s ) may be regulating the <i> Snail </i> gene .
A variety of extracellular signals have an impact on the cell type @-@ specific expression of different Snail family members , and many of them , including Wnts , BMPs , FGFs , and TGF-βs , also affect hair bud development [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b02"> 2 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b28"> 28 </xref>@ ] .
Since Snail is not expressed in cultured skin keratinocytes that secrete active BMPs and FGFs ( see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g001"> Figure 1 </xref>@ B ) , we focused our attention on Wnt and TGF-β signaling as more likely candidates for Snail induction in this cell type .
Previously , we showed that effective transmission of a Wnt-3a signal in cultured keratinocytes can be achieved through their exposure to the BMP inhibitor noggin , which induces LEF-1 expression [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] .
In vitro , these conditions down-regulated the <i> E-cadherin </i> promoter and induced a LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin @-@ sensitive reporter gene , <i> TOPFLASH </i> [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] .
In contrast , Snail expression was not induced by these conditions ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005"> Figure 5 </xref>@ A ) .
Thus , despite essential roles for Wnts and noggin in hair follicle specification [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b29"> 29 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b30"> 30 </xref>@ ] , our studies did not support an essential role for these signals in governing <i> Snail </i> expression in keratinocytes .
TGF-β1 has been shown to induce Snail family members in hepatocytes and heart [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b15"> 15 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b31"> 31 </xref>@ ] .
In keratinocytes , however , TGF-β1 inhibits keratinocyte growth and seems to be involved in triggering the destructive phase of the cycling hair follicle [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b32"> 32 </xref>@ ] .
Of the loss @-@ of @-@ function mutations generated in each of the <i> TGF-β </i> genes , only the <i> TGF-β2 </i> null state blocked follicle development at the hair bud stage [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b32"> 32 </xref>@ ] .
Thus , we turned towards addressing whether TGF-β2 might be involved in regulating <i> Snail </i> expression in keratinocytes isolated from the basal layer of the epidermis .
Though there is no cell culture system available to specifically study placodal cells , these keratinocytes are their progenitors and are the closest approximation available to study the behavior of epithelial cells of the placode .
Interestingly , treatment of cultured keratinocytes with as little as 5 ng @/@ ml of TGF-β2 caused a rapid and transient induction of Snail ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005"> Figure 5 </xref>@ B ) .
Following this treatment , Snail protein was detected within 30 min , peaked at 2 h , and then declined thereafter .
The induction of Snail appeared to be specific for the active form of the growth factor , as pretreatment of TGF-β2 for 10 min at 100 °C obliterated the response [ @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005"> Figure 5 </xref>@ B , lanes marked ( – ) ] .
By contrast , although TGF-β receptor activation remained elevated during the duration of the experiment ( as measured by the sustained phosphorylation of the downstream effector SMAD2 ) <i> Snail </i> expression could not be maintained ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005"> Figure 5 </xref>@ B ) .
Thus , although <i> Snail </i> expression correlated with phosphorylated SMAD2 ( pSMAD2 ) induction , its decline seemed to rely on secondary downstream events .
The rapid kinetics of Snail expression were reflected at the mRNA level , suggesting that <i> Snail </i> promoter activity in keratinocytes might be sensitive to TGF-β2 signaling ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005"> Figure 5 </xref>@ C ) .
To test this possibility , we engineered a transgene driving the β-galactosidase reporter under the control of approximately 2.2 kb of promoter sequence located 5′ from the transcription initiation site of the mouse <i> Snail </i> gene .
At 2 d after transient transfection , keratinocytes were treated with TGF-β2 ( t = 0 ) and then assayed for transgene activity over the same time course in which we had observed Snail protein induction .
The results of this experiment are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005"> Figure 5 </xref>@ D.
Within 0.5 h of TGF-β2 treatment , <i> Snail </i> promoter activity had increased 3 @-@ fold , and by 2 h , it peaked to approximately 10 @-@ fold over control levels ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005"> Figure 5 </xref>@ D ) .
Thereafter , <i> Snail </i> promoter activity rapidly returned to the basal levels seen in unstimulated keratinocytes .
The kinetics of <i> Snail </i> promoter activity closely paralleled those observed for Snail protein induction .
Moreover , the stimulatory effects appeared to be specific to TGF-β2 , since they were abrogated either by heat inactivation of the TGF-β2 protein or by mutation of a putative SMAD binding element located about 1.8 kb 5′ from the <i> Snail </i> transcription start site ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g005"> Figure 5 </xref>@ D ) .
Taken together , these results suggested that in keratinocytes , TGF-β2 signaling results in a pSMAD2 @-@ dependent transient activation of the <i> Snail </i> gene , and that maintenance of Snail protein relies , in part , upon sustained promoter activity .
The brevity of <i> Snail </i> gene and protein induction in TGF-β2 treated cultured keratinocytes resembled the temporal appearance of <i> Snail </i> mRNA and protein at the initiation of hair follicle morphogenesis in embryonic mouse skin .
To test whether TGF-β2 might be required for <i> Snail </i> induction in hair bud formation in vivo , we first analyzed whether TGF-β2 was expressed in or around the hair bud .
Consistent with previous observations [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b33"> 33 </xref>@ ] , an anti @-@ TGF-β2 antibody labeled developing hair buds ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ A ) .
This labeling appeared to be specific as judged by the lack of staining in follicle buds from mice homozygous for a <i> TGF-β2 </i> null mutation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ A ; [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b34"> 34 </xref>@ ] ) .
Moreover , the downstream effector of TGF-β2 signaling , pSMAD2 , was also expressed in WT , but not <i> TGF-β2 </i>@ -@ null , hair buds ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ B ) .
Together , these data underscore the importance of the TGF-β2 isoform despite expression of both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in developing hair buds at this stage .
To further explore the possible relation between Snail and TGF-β2 , we examined the status of Snail expression in <i> TGF-β2 </i>@ -@ null hair buds .
As judged by immunohistochemistry , Snail protein was absent from E17.5 skin of <i> TGF-β2 @- </i>@ null embryos but not from that of control littermates ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ C ) .
This effect appeared to be exerted at the transcriptional level , since <i> Snail </i> mRNAs were also not found in <i> TGF-β2 </i> null hair buds under conditions in which the signal was readily detected in the hair buds of littermate skin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ D ) .
Conversely , in 2 @-@ wk @-@ old <i> K14 @-@ Smad2 </i> Tg mice , which display elevated TGF-β signaling in skin [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b35"> 35 </xref>@ ] , Snail protein was readily detected by Western blot analyses , where it was not found in postnatal skin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ E ) .
Taken together , these results provide compelling evidence that TGF-β2 is functionally important for inducing <i> Snail </i> gene expression in a pSMAD @-@ dependent manner in developing hair buds .
Whether pMARK activity also contributes to Snail induction was not addressed in the present study [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b15"> 15 </xref>@ ] .
Although some hair buds still formed in <i> TGF-β2 </i> null skin , their number was reduced by approximately 50 % [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b32"> 32 </xref>@ ] .
Thus , although the pathway mediated by TGF-β2 signaling impacts the earliest step of epithelial invagination , it does not appear to be essential for bud morphogenesis .
Consistent with this notion , basement membrane remodeling still took place in the <i> TGF-β2 </i>@ -@ null buds , as judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against β4 integrin , an integral component of keratinocyte @-@ mediated adhesion to its underlying basement membrane ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ F ) .
In contrast , TGF-β2 signaling appeared to be an important factor for the early proliferation that occurs in the developing hair buds , as judged by anti @-@ Ki67 and anti @-@ pMAPK immunofluorescence ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> 6 </xref>@ G ) .
If TGF-β2 stimulates <i> Snail </i> expression in developing buds , loss of this morphogen would be expected to affect the expression of genes that are typically repressed by Snail .
Since a major target for Snail @-@ mediated repression is the <i> E-cadherin </i> gene [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b12"> 12 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b13"> 13 </xref>@ ] , we investigated the status of E-cadherin in <i> TGF-β2 </i>@ -@ null buds .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ H , hair buds in TGF-β2 null skin displayed elevated immunofluorescence staining relative to their WT counterparts .
Previously we demonstrated that the concerted action of the extracellular signals Wnt and noggin are required for the generation of a LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin transcription complex to repress <i> E-cadherin </i> transcription at the onset of hair fate specification .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> Figure 6 </xref>@ I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g006"> 6 </xref>@ J , both WT and TGF-β2 null buds exhibited nuclear LEF-1 and β-catenin localization , signs that the Wnt @-@ noggin signaling pathway was intact .
These data suggest that during hair follicle morphogenesis , TGF-β2 functions subsequently to Wnt @/@ noggin @-@ mediated determination of hair fate .
Moreover , through activation of <i> Snail </i> gene expression , TGF-β2 appears to work in tandem with these other morphogens to down-regulate E-cadherin levels , which contributes to the activation of proliferative circuitries .
Discussion
During budding morphogenesis , intersecting signaling networks from the epithelium and mesenchyme govern transcriptional , adhesive , polarity , and motility programs in these select groups of cells .
The dynamic nuclear and cytosolic changes that take place during this time form the cornerstone for organ morphogenesis .
Two major challenges in understanding the mechanisms underlying a particular budding process are to order the temporal sequence of external cues involved and then to dissect how the cells of the developing bud translate these signals into the downstream events of cellular remodeling , proliferation , and differentiation .
Our studies here provide some insights into how these events are orchestrated during hair bud formation in developing skin .
Signaling during Early Hair Follicle Morphogenesis
Recent studies on hair bud morphogenesis suggest that Wnt signals likely from the epithelium and BMP inhibitory signals from the underlying mesenchyme converge to produce an active transcription factor complex involving β-catenin and LEF-1 , which in turn plays a key role in specifying the hair follicle fate [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b29"> 29 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b30"> 30 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b36"> 36 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b37"> 37 </xref>@ ] .
Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) and TGF-β2 signaling also play essential roles in follicle morphogenesis , but in contrast to <i> β-catenin </i> null skin , in which follicle invaginations are absent [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b30"> 30 </xref>@ ] , some hair buds still form in the absence of LEF-1 , Shh , or TGF-β2 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b32"> 32 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b38"> 38 </xref>@ ] .
These likely reflect the first wave of follicle ( i.e. , guard hair ) morphogenesis , which accounts for a small number ( fewer than 5 % ) of hairs and is under distinct regulatory control .
Guard hairs form in the absence of LEF-1 and TGF-β2 , and we have found that they also fail to express Snail at the budding stage of development ( unpublished data ) .
How E-cadherin is regulated in guard hairs remains to be determined .
Several candidates include other Snail family members such as Slug or twist , or alternatively , transcription factors involving β-catenin and a different member of the LEF-1 @/@ TCF/ @<i> Sry </i>@ -@ type HMG box ( commonly known as SOX ) family [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b39"> 39 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b40"> 40 </xref>@ ] .
Further investigation will be required to determine whether the signaling pathway we have elucidated here is a theme with multiple variations .
TGF-βs are known to promote withdrawal of keratinocytes from the cell cycle [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b41"> 41 </xref>@ ] .
Hence , when TGF-β2 protein was detected at the transition between the growing and destructive phases of the adult hair cycle , research initially and naturally focused on a role for this family member in cessation of growth and @/@ or triggering apoptosis ( [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b42"> 42 </xref>@ ] and references therein ) .
However , in contrast to <i> TGF-β1 </i>@ -@ null skin , which exhibits an extended growing phase of postnatal hair follicles , <i> TGF-β2 </i>@ -@ null skin displays an embryonic block in follicle bud progression [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b32"> 32 </xref>@ ] .
Although this phenotype is consistent with TGF-β2 's embryonic expression patterns [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b33"> 33 </xref>@ ] , about 50 % of <i> TGF-β2 </i> null buds appear unable to progress to the down @-@ growth phase , a feature that can not be explained readily on the basis of previously established effects of TGF-βs .
Our finding that TGF-β2 is upstream from Ki67 expression and MAPK activation lends further support to the notion that hair follicle keratinocytes at this early stage of development react to TGF-β2 signaling in a fashion opposite to that typically expected for TGF-β factors .
This said , based upon pSMAD2 immunohistochemistry , the immediate steps of downstream signaling appeared to be intact .
Thus , we surmise that the proliferative outcome is likely to be rooted in differences in the repertoire of activated SMAD target genes .
In this regard , the positive effects of TGF-β2 on proliferation within the hair bud may be more analogous to what has been seen in progression of squamous cell carcinoma to metastatic carcinoma [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b43"> 43 </xref>@ ] rather than that typically observed for keratinocytes [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b44"> 44 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b45"> 45 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b46"> 46 </xref>@ ] .
The prior identification of the <i> Snail </i> gene as a potential target of TGF-β signaling [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b15"> 15 </xref>@ ] was intriguing , given the temporal wave of <i> Snail </i> gene expression that occurs in the developing hair bud .
The additional correlation between epithelial hyperproliferation and <i> Snail </i> transgene expression further fostered our interest in a possible link between TGF-β2 and Snail .
Our functional studies demonstrate that without TGF-β2 , <i> Snail </i> expression is abolished in the mutant hair buds , and conversely , in <i> K14 @-@ Smad2 </i> skin , <i> Snail </i> is ectopically activated .
Moreover , our in vitro studies indicate that even sustained TGF-β2 exposure may cause only a transient induction of Snail , offering a possible explanation as to why Snail is so briefly expressed during hair follicle morphogenesis .
An additional point worth mentioning is that prolonged expression of Tg <i> Snail </i> in postnatal skin resulted in morphological and biochemical signs of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( unpublished data ) , underscoring why transient Snail expression may be so important during normal hair follicle morphogenesis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b18"> 18 </xref>@ ] .
At first glance , the sparsity in hair coat of K14 @- @<i> Snail </i> Tg mice seemed indicative of a defect in follicle formation ( see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030011-g002"> Figure 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Closer inspection , however , revealed that not all hairs penetrated the hyperthickened Tg epidermis .
Several factors may contribute to the seemingly normal follicle development in these mice .
One obvious factor is the K14 promoter , which is elevated in the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath ( ORS ) of the hair follicle , but is markedly down-regulated in developing embryonic hair buds as well as in the postnatal hair progenitor cells .
The K14 promoter is also less active in the ORS than epidermis and hence this might also account for the lack of apparent response of the ORS to ectopic Snail .
Additional contributing factors could be the multiplicity of Snail family members and their differential expression , the saturation , and @/@ or diversity of regulatory mechanisms that govern AJ formation , migration , and proliferation in the follicle ORS .
Distinguishing between these possibilities must await the generation of mice harboring skin @-@ specific loss @-@ of @-@ function <i> Snail </i> mutations .
Links between Signaling , Transcriptional Cascades , Epithelial Remodeling , and Proliferation in the Hair Bud
Previously , we discovered that early during hair follicle morphogenesis , <i> E-cadherin </i> gene expression is down-regulated concomitantly with the invagination of developing bud cells into the skin [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] .
Because the timing of this event correlated with the activation of a LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin transcription factor complex [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b20"> 20 </xref>@ ] , we were intrigued by the presence of a putative LEF-1 @/@ TCF binding site in the <i> E-cadherin </i> promoter .
This prompted an investigation that subsequently led to our discovery that LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin can contribute to repression of <i> E-cadherin </i> gene expression in skin keratinocytes [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] .
In the course of these studies , we also noted that Snail can also contribute to this process in keratinocytes in vitro , and our present studies revealed that Snail is expressed at the right place and time to be physiologically relevant in the process .
In <i> noggin </i>@ -@ null embryonic skin , LEF-1 expression and subsequent activation of the LEF-1 @/@ β-catenin reporter gene is abrogated in the developing placodes .
The corresponding failure of <i> E-cadherin </i> down-regulation underscores the importance of Wnt @/@ noggin signaling in regulating this event in follicle morphogenesis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref>@ ] .
Conditional gene targeting studies will be necessary to establish whether Snail family members also contribute to the down-regulation in <i> E-cadherin </i> gene expression that occurs during follicle formation .
However , it is intriguing that <i> K14 @-@ Snail </i> Tg epidermis displayed a marked down-regulation in E-cadherin expression , thereby demonstrating its potential to do so in skin .
Our prior findings showed that by elevating E-cadherin levels or by conditionally ablating <i> α-catenin , </i> hair follicle morphogenesis can be impaired [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b04"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b07"> 7 </xref>@ ] .
The marked epidermal hyperproliferation seen in the <i> K14 @-@ Snail </i> Tg skin , coupled with the converse suppression of proliferation and Snail in <i> TGF-β2 </i>@ -@ null hair buds led us to wonder whether the down-regulation of E-cadherin during follicle morphogenesis might have a direct impact on elevating the proliferative state of these cells .
Our Tg studies suggested that , at least in part through its regulation of <i> E-cadherin </i> , Snail is able to influence the subcellular localization of a variety of AJ @-@ associated proteins .
One of these appears to be Ajuba , which was previously shown to have the dual capacity to bind Grb-2 as well as α-catenin [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b09"> 9 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b10"> 10 </xref>@ ] .
Our studies revealed that in skin keratinocytes that either harbor a conditional null mutation in <i> α-catenin </i> or that overexpress Snail , Ajuba develops an interaction with Grb-2 that is otherwise not observed in WT keratinocytes .
The corresponding abilities of either <i> Snail </i>@ -@ transfected or <i> Ajuba </i>@ -@ transfected keratinocytes to exhibit elevated activation of the Ras @-@ MAPK pathway suggest that the Grb-2 association of Ajuba under conditions of reduced levels of AJ proteins may be directly relevant to the parallel in hyperproliferation .
In stable epithelial ( i.e. , Madin @-@ Darby canine kidney , or MDCK ) cell lines , Snail has been shown to block cell cycle progression and promote motility and shape changes for invasion [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b47"> 47 </xref>@ ] .
While our in vivo studies are consistent with a role for Snail in motility and epithelial remodeling , they differ with respect to Snail 's apparent proliferative effects .
A priori , this could be simply due to variations in the response of different cell types to Snail expression .
Alternatively , these differences may be relevant to the benefit of using mouse models to reveal functions not always recapitulated in stable cell line models .
Future studies should highlight the underlying reasons for these opposing results .
Irrespective of these differences , our in vivo studies do not stand alone , as there are many situations in which a down-regulation in AJ proteins correlate with enhanced proliferation .
In fact , a myriad of diverse mechanisms have been implicated in activating epithelial proliferation upon down-regulation of AJ proteins [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b07"> 7 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b24"> 24 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030011-b48"> 48 </xref>@ ] .
Sifting through these converging pathways is likely to be a difficult and painstaking process .
This said , by identifying the status of different players involved in specific cell types and at specific stages in development , our mechanistic understanding of how intercellular remodeling is linked to proliferation in epithelial morphogenesis should begin to surface in the future .
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which these networks converge is also a prerequisite for understanding how these processes go awry during tumorigenesis .

Activation of the MAPK pathway is a common event in uveal melanomas although it rarely occurs through mutation of <i> BRAF </i> or <i> RAS </i> ( PMID : 15928660 )
<sec-title level="1"> RESULTS </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Mutation analysis </sec-title>
Of the 11 uveal melanoma cell lines under study , only one cell line ( Ocm 1 ) carried a <i> BRAF </i> mutation , the common V599E ( also described by Calipel <i> et al </i> and Kilic <i> et al </i> ) .
All primary tumour specimens were wild type for <i> BRAF </i>@ .
No mutations were found in the <i> NRAS </i> , <i> HRAS </i> or <i> KRAS </i> genes , in both the cell lines and primary tissue .
<sec-title level="2"> Western blotting </sec-title>
In order to assess the level of expression and the activation ( by phosphorylation ) of members of the MAPK pathway downstream of <i> RAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> , Western blot analysis was performed on uveal melanoma cell lines ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2A </xref> ) .
The expression levels of the downstream members of RAS and BRAF are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1 </xref>@ .
In response to the constitutively activating <i> BRAF </i> mutation in Ocm 1 , downstream members of the MAPK pathway show activation ( phosphorylated MEK , ERK and ELK ) .
Levels of expression of the downstream members were not different in the two cell lines derived from the same primary tumour ( 92.1 and 92.2 ) , except for phosphorylated MEK , indicating that there had been little clonal divergence between the cell populations during <i> in vitro </i> culturing .
Interestingly , compared to the phosphorylation status of these members in Ocm 1 , most cell lines show activation of MEK , ERK and ELK ; however , these cell lines show this activation in the absence of mutations in the upstream <i> RAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> genes .
The levels of total ERK were remarkably similar across all cell lines , with the exception of two cell lines Mel 285 and Mel 290 , which had significantly higher levels of total ERK than the others .
In keeping with this observation , these two cell lines also have the highest levels of phosphorylated @-@ ERK .
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref> shows that there is no significant influence of serum on the activity of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in these cell lines , as reported recently by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3"> Calipel <i> et al </i> ( 2003 ) </xref>@ .

In seven of the 19 primary tumours , less than 5 % of the tumour cells stained positively for ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and nine tumours for phosphorylated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
Despite the lack of mutations in the <i> RAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> genes in this set of uveal melanomas , it is noteworthy that we observed phosphorylated ( active ) ERK1 @/@ ERK2 expression in 10 of 19 tumours .
There was no significant association between ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation and tumour location or cell type .
The scoring system for each antibody can not be compared between antibodies since the antibodies recognise different epitopes and with different affinities ; therefore , the staining intensity on Western or by immunohistochemistry is relative only to the other samples for the particular antibody used .
Transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells alters responsiveness to inflammatory cytokines ( PMID : 16271139 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
Normal epithelial cells respond strongly to OSM , IFNγ and EGF , and respond moderately to IL-6 , and do not exhibit a detectable response to LIF .
In preneoplastic cells , the aberrant signaling that was detected most frequently was an elevated activation of ERK , a reduced or increased IL-6 and EGF response , and an increased LIF response .
Some of these changes in preneoplastic cell signaling approach those observed in established lung cancer cell lines .
Epigenetic control of LIF receptor expression by histone acetylation can account for the gain of LIF responsiveness .
OSM and macrophage @-@ derived cytokines suppressed proliferation of normal epithelial cells , but reduced inhibition or even stimulated proliferation was noted for preneoplastic cells .
These alterations likely contribute to the supporting effects that inflammation has on lung tumor progression .

<sec-title level="2"> Transformed lung epithelial cell lines have grossly abnormal patterns of cytokine responsiveness </sec-title>
We predicted that if oncogenic transformation of lung epithelial cells is associated with altered responsiveness to inflammation and reduced growth @-@ inhibition , then the most prominent deviations from the regulatory phenotype should be seen in advanced lung cancer cells .
Therefore , as first step , we determined if responsiveness to members of the IL-6 family ( IL-6 , OSM and LIF ) were detectable in <i> established </i> lines of malignant human non @-@ small cell lung carcinoma cells .
The responsiveness to the cytokines was defined by measurable phosphorylation of STAT and ERK .
This is a treatment reaction that is a measure for the level of active cytokine receptors and downstream signaling pathways in the target cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref>@ ] .
Normal type II epithelial cells and pulmonary fibroblasts were included in the analyses to gauge cell type @-@ specific differences in signaling reactions ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK was sufficient for identifying responsiveness to cytokines in specific cell types ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> shows representative immunoblots and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> presents the quantitative data from independently performed experiments involving 5 separate matched cultures of type II epithelial cells and fibroblasts ) .
In brief , normal type II epithelial cells showed the following features ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> , top panel ) : OSM strongly activated phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK , while IL-6 was less effective , and LIF did not produce any detectable response .
EGF stimulated phosphorylation of ERK in the range of OSM , while insulin was minimally effective .
Fibroblasts exhibited a prominent LIF response and a several @-@ fold higher activation of ERK relative to STAT3 by IL-6 cytokines ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> , bottom panel ) , in contrast to normal epithelial cells .
The maximal level of receptor action in epithelial cells was reached after 15 min agonist treatment ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> , example of OSM on normal type II epithelial cells ) .
Deviations from the normal regulatory phenotype of epithelial cells were already evident in immortalized bronchial epithelial cells , HBE4 ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) and HBE137 ( not shown ) .
These cell lines responded to IL-6 cytokines like normal epithelial cells , but showed a detectable STAT3 signaling by LIF and a ~ 2 @-@ fold higher ERK activation by OSM and IL-6 .
More profound differences were detected in carcinoma lines ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> and not shown ) .
In carcinoma cell lines , the major trends included a strong STAT3 activation by LIF ( ADLC , H125 ) , an increased ( ADLC , H23 ) or decreased STAT3 activation by IL-6 ( H125 , H324 ) , a decreased ERK activation by EGF ( H522 ) , and a treatment @-@ independent , constitutive activation of the ERK pathway ( H23 ) .
Despite the substantial changes in response patterns , STAT and ERK signaling in response to OSM was consistently high in all analyzed lung cancer cell lines .
Moreover , the cell @-@ type and line specific differences in STAT3 and ERK signaling were not due different expression of the signaling proteins as demonstrated by the comparable expression level of total STAT3 and ERK proteins among the cell types ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Cell line @-@ specific effect of cytokines on proliferation </sec-title>
To relate cytokine signaling with effects on cell proliferation , representative lung cell types were cultured for 6 days in growth medium containing in addition increasing concentrations of OSM , IL-6 or LIF ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) .
In all cell types , OSM reduced in a dose @-@ dependent manner proliferation , with maximal effect at a concentration of 20 to 100 ng @/@ ml .
Maximal inhibition varied among the cell types and ranged from > 80 % ( normal primary epithelial cells ) to ~ 40 % ( HBE137 , A549 , fibroblasts ) and ~ 20 % ( H23 ) .
IL-6 and LIF did not appreciably alter proliferation of epithelial or fibroblastic cells .
The comparative analyses also indicated that immortalization of epithelial cells with the E6E7 gene ( HBE4 or HBE137 ) or constitutive activation of ERK pathway ( H23 ) correlated with a lower growth inhibition by OSM .
The same cells were tested for growth in the presence of conditioned medium from lipopolysaccaride ( LPS ) activated macrophages .
Such medium is considered to contain a physiologically relevant mixture of inflammatory mediators ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
The LPS macrophage medium suppressed the proliferation of epithelial cells in a dose @-@ dependent fashion ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) .
Suppression ranged from > 80 % ( primary epithelial cells and A549 ) to < 20 % in HBE137 and H23 .
In contrast , the same treatment led to enhanced proliferation of fibroblasts .
Taken together , these data indicated that cytokine responsiveness and growth regulation by OSM and inflammatory mediators are indeed subject to alterations in lung epithelial cells in part as a function of immortalization and transformation .
Characteristic changes in the cellular response patterns may serve as markers for the transformation process or may even contribute functionally to tumorigenesis .
One of the key questions is at what stage in the transformation of lung epithelial cells are these changes established .
To address this question , we used short-term primary cultures of non @-@ immortalized epithelial cells derived from normal and pathologically distinct stages of premalignant lesions sampled by brushing during bronchoscopy of patients .
The experimental approach also allowed us to establish the more basic information of what is the cytokine responsiveness of normal epithelial cells and what is the range among individuals .
<sec-title level="2"> Application of primary epithelial cells derived from bronchial brushing </sec-title>
Epithelial cell cultures were established from the brushed bronchial epithelium .
Biopsies of the same sites were processed for pathological and cytological evaluation .
The pathological findings ( normal , metaplasia , dysplasia or non @-@ invasive carcinoma <i> in situ </i> ) were subsequently applied in the interpretation of the signaling data ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> ) .
No cases of invasive carcinoma or advanced lung cancer were included .
From May 2000 to March 2005 , 192 separate brushings were taken from 96 patients ( EC-1 to EC-96 ) .
From these , 113 brushings ( 59 % ) yielded sufficient epithelial cells that expanded to cultures suitable for functional analyses .
Approximately 50 % of sites initially judged to be abnormal by bronchoscopy proved to be normal by histology .
Based on immunostaining , every cell preparation consisted of > 95 % cytokeratin @-@ positive epithelial cells .
All cultures derived from normal and abnormal sites showed essentially the same epithelial cell morphology .
To determine whether or not the primary cultures demonstrated any gross chromosomal abnormalities , cells were analyzed by SKY .
With the exception of one carcinoma , the cells showed normal karyotypes .
The carcinoma cell culture carried a chromosome 10 deletion ( q11.2 @-@ q22 ) in all metaphase spreads .
<sec-title level="2"> Paired epithelial cell cultures indicate the occurrence of altered cytokine responsiveness at early stage of transformation </sec-title>
The cytokine responsiveness of the epithelial cells was determined by the activation of signaling and by the effect on DNA synthesis .
Signaling was measured in first passage subcultures by treatment with cytokines and growth factors for 15 min followed by immunodetection of the phosphorylated signaling proteins ( representative example in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) .
The level of phosphorylated STAT1 , STAT3 and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 were quantified and expressed relative to the level of these proteins in OSM @-@ treated normal cultures in each pair ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A–F </xref> ) .
The analyses of normal bronchial epithelial cells defined the following response pattern .
The reaction to cytokine treatment ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) was comparable to that of type II epithelial cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) .
Data from 63 separate preparations of normal bronchial epithelial cell cultures indicated that basal level of phosphorylated ERK was consistently low ( 7.5 ± 5.6 % of OSM level ; mean ± SD ) and the basal levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT1 were generally low to non @-@ detectable .
OSM prominently activated ERK ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> & @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) and STAT3 ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> & @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4D </xref> ) .
The response was uniformly high among cultures from different individuals .
IL-6 response , although quite variable among individuals , was consistently below that of OSM .
The level of activated ERK was 37 ± 18 % of OSM ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> & @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) and activated STAT3 was 63 ± + 27 % ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> & @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4D </xref> ) .
The two @-@ fold lower activation of ERK relative to STAT3 by IL-6 is due to the difference in signaling by the IL-6 and OSM receptor [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref>@ ] .
LIF did not elicit a measurable ERK and STAT3 signaling in any of normal epithelial cell culture .
EGF activated ERK to 90 ± 29 % of OSM level ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> & @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
EGF generally had no measurable effect on STAT3 even when the cells were treated with EGF for longer than 15 minutes ( not shown ) .
In all cases , IFNγ did not appreciably activate ERK and STAT3 , but yielded highest level of STAT1 phosphorylation ( 2441 ± 2073 % of OSM level ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4E </xref> & @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4F </xref> ) .
The IFNγ response from patient to patient showed the highest variability among the cytokine responses , even though paired cultures from individual patients exhibited highly consistent levels of STAT1 activation by IFNγ .
The reproducibility of detecting comparable patterns in independently derived cell cultures was assessed in those paired cultures in which the samples were initially classified as " abnormal " ( or " suspicious " ) by autofluorescence bronchoscopy but proved normal by subsequent pathological analysis ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A , C </xref> & @<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4E </xref> ) .
When cell cultures were derived from histologically normal areas with abnormal fluorescence , the level and range of signaling reactions elicited by the treatments were essentially identical to those with normal histology and normal fluorescence .
ERK activation by OSM was 108 ± 35 % , by IL-6 was 31 ± 15 % , and by EGF was 85 ± 40 % .
STAT3 activation by OSM was 97 ± 31 % and by IL-6 was 63 ± 27 % .
The cytokine @-@ induced activation of ERK and STAT3 in paired cultures indicated highly consistent response patterns ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4G </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4H </xref> , left side panels ) .
Confirmed premalignant epithelial cells ( metaplasia , dysplasia and carcinoma ) exhibited two recurring aberrant phenotypes when compared with normal cells .
The first aberrancy was the elevated basal or cytokine @-@ stimulated level of phosphorylated ERK ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4G </xref> , right panel ) and the second was the reactivation of LIFR function ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4D </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4H </xref> , right panel ) .
In the 23 preneoplastic cell cultures , the basal level of phosphorylated ERK was increased to 22 ± 27 % of the OSM value ( p = 0.07 ) .
Based on two @-@ sample Kolmogorov @-@ Smirnov test , two cases that were cultured from metaplastic foci were above the 95 % confidence interval .
Preneoplastic cells showed also an overall trend of increased ERK signaling when treated with OSM ( 133 ± 66 % ; p = 0.17 ) or IL-6 ( 53 ± 38 % ; p = 0.01 ) but not with EGF ( 85 ± 67 % ; p = 0.46 ) .
The ERK signaling by IL-6 and EGF included several cases that lie outside of the 95 % confidence interval .
For the IL-6 response , 3 @/@ 23 cases were above and 5 @/@ 23 cases below the 95 % confidence interval , and for EGF response , 4 @/@ 23 cases were above and 3 @/@ 23 cases below .
STAT3 phosphorylation by OSM and IL-6 , and STAT1 phosphorylation by OSM , IL-6 and IFNγ did not show significant differences among the cases tested ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C–F </xref> ) , in contrast to ERK phosphorylation .
Among the abnormal epithelial cells with elevated basal ERK phosphorylation ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) , the two cell cultures from metaplastic foci in the airway were distinct because the basal ERK phosphorylation that was equivalent to the OSM @-@ treated control culture ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> ) .
The increased phosphorylation of ERK , but not of STATs in these metaplastic cells was similar to the regulatory phenotype of NCI H23 tumor cell line ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) .
Due to the elevated ERK phosphorylation , the response to EGF was obscured , even though a normal or even enhanced level of EGFR could be demonstrated ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> ) .
The high basal level phosphorylation of ERK was abrogated by treatment with U0126 , an inhibitor for MEK1 ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5C </xref> ) , suggesting a constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway upstream of ERK in these metaplastic cells .
The pair @-@ wise comparison also revealed that 5 @/@ 23 of the abnormal cases ( 4 metaplasia and 1 carcinoma ) had a LIF response detectable by the activation of ERK and STAT3 ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> , Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B , D,G </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4H </xref> ) .
Three cases ( 2 metaplasia and 1 carcinoma ) produced a signaling that lied outside of the 95 % confidence interval .
The carcinoma case also included a prominent reduction of IL-6 receptor function ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) , which resulted in an overall cytokine response pattern comparable to that of the NCI H125 tumor cell line ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) .
The changes in signaling reactions correlated with receptor expression .
The expression of LIFRα in normal cells was undetectable by immunoblotting whereas expression was observed in the 5 cultures of abnormal cells with LIF response .
The re @-@ expression of LIFR in various cell types is controlled by an epigenetic process that depends on histone acetylation within CpG islands of the LIFR promoter region [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref>@ ] .
To determine whether altered protein acetylation could account for the switch in LIF responsiveness from normal to carcinoma cells , the normal epithelial cells were treated for 6 h with the histone deacetylase inhibitor FR901228 .
The treatment induced the expression of LIFRα and established a LIF @-@ dependent STAT3 and ERK signaling that was comparable to the level observed in the carcinoma cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
A similar FR901228 treatment of the carcinoma cells further enhanced LIFR expression and LIF @-@ dependent signaling ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
Interestingly , the same treatment reduced he expression of IL-6R in normal cells resulting in a response pattern as found in the corresponding carcinoma cells from the same patient ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> OSM and secreted macrophage factors attenuate proliferation of bronchial epithelial cells </sec-title>
DNA synthesis of the epithelial cells was inhibited by OSM and LPS conditioned medium from of activated macrophages in a dose @-@ dependent fashion ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7 </xref> ) .
The data for all cultures identified as normal cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7A </xref> ) indicated that low concentrations of OSM ( ≤ 0.1 ng @/@ ml ) or LPS conditioned macrophage medium ( < 10 @<sup> -@ 3 </sup> dilution ) had no appreciable modulating effects .
Only at higher concentrations , suppression of DNA synthesis became evident ( p < 0.05 ) .
In contrast , several cultures of metaplastic and dysplastic cells exhibited the trend , in which the cells responded to low doses of OSM or conditioned medium from macrophages by a stimulation of DNA synthesis ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7B </xref> ) .
The exact sign test using the paired samples ( normal and abnormal ) indicated a significant increase of DNA synthesis by low dose ( 10 @<sup> -@ 3 </sup> dilution ) of macrophage medium ( p = 0.016 ) .
The comparison of the data from paired cultures by the Wilcoxon two @-@ sample test also indicated that DNA synthesis in the abnormal epithelial cells was significantly increased at lowest concentration of OSM ( p = 0.02 ) and macrophage medium ( p = 0.005 ) relative to the normal cells .
The reduced sensitivity for inhibited DNA synthesis in all cases could be correlated with metaplasia which shows enhanced ERK phosphorylation in response to cytokine treatment ( example of dysplastic cells in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7C </xref> ) .
In addition , we noted that in premalignant cells the basal ERK phosphorylation approached the level of OSM @-@ treated cells or EGF @-@ treated cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
In addition , the thymidine incorporation by premalignant cells maintained in growth medium was close to two @-@ fold higher than in the corresponding normal cultures ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5D </xref> ) .
As expected , the ERK activity was reduced by treatment in both normal and carcinoma cells with U0126 which correlates with the suppression of DNA synthesis observed ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5C </xref> ) .
High concentrations of OSM or macrophage factors were effective to reduce this intrinsically stimulated DNA synthesis in both normal and premalignant epithelial cell cultures .
MUC1 alters oncogenic events and transcription in human breast cancer cells ( PMID : 16846534 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
Transcription of several genes was altered after transfection of MUC1 siRNA , including decreased <i> MAP2K1 </i> ( MEK1 ) , <i> JUN </i> , <i> PDGFA </i> , <i> CDC25A </i> , <i> VEGF </i> and <i> ITGAV </i> ( integrin α @<sub> v </sub> ) , and increased <i> TNF </i> , <i> RAF1 </i> , and <i> MMP2 </i>@ .
Additional changes were seen at the protein level , such as increased expression of c-Myc , heightened phosphorylation of AKT , and decreased activation of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
These were correlated with cellular events , as MUC1 siRNA in the MDA @-@ MB-468 line decreased proliferation and invasion , and increased stress @-@ induced apoptosis .
Intriguingly , BT-20 cells displayed similar levels of apoptosis regardless of siRNA , and actually increased proliferation after MUC1 siRNA .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> siRNA transfection decreases MUC1 expression in breast cancer cell lines </sec-title>
Two human breast cancer cell lines , MDA @-@ MB-468 and BT-20 , were transiently transfected with a pool of four siRNA oligonucleotides directed against the MUC1 mRNA ( 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 ) , or a control oligonucleotide directed against luciferase ( 468.siLuc and BT.siLuc ) .
Both cell lines express high levels of MUC1 , making them promising targets for this analysis .
Western blots ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1a </xref> ) show successful knockdown of both the extracellular domain and cytoplasmic tail fragments of MUC1 ; luciferase siRNA does not substantially change the level of MUC1 compared to parental cells .
468.siMUC1 show a substantial decrease in the amount of MUC1 @-@ CT , while BT.siMUC1 show slightly less knockdown of MUC1 @-@ CT .
Both MDA @-@ MB-468 and BT-20 display a less dramatic decrease of MUC1 extracellular domain compared to MUC1 @-@ CT ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1a </xref> ) ; this likely represents protein synthesized prior to transfection , and may reflect differences in the turnover rates of the two subunits .
Analysis of the MUC1 extracellular domain by flow cytometry confirms that both cell lines substantially decrease MUC1 expression after siRNA ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1b </xref> ) .
By flow cytometry , 468.siMUC1 averaged 75 % knockdown of MUC1 compared to 468.siLuc ; and BT.siMUC1 averaged 50 % knockdown relative to BT.siLuc .
These effects could be titrated with the concentration of siRNA , were seen as early as 24 hours post @-@ transfection ( data not shown ) and lasted to at least 96 h post @-@ transfection ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1b </xref> ) .
All experiments were conducted within 48 to 96 hours after siRNA transfection .
Similar results were obtained using two independent oligonucleotides designed in our lab ( data not shown ) , designated ' 882 ' and ' 956 ' for the initial codon recognized by each .
<sec-title level="2"> Transcriptional changes are seen after MUC1 siRNA </sec-title>
Recent work indicates that MUC1 may affect transcription both directly via interaction with transcription factors and indirectly ( for example , through modulating signaling ) .
To study the effects of MUC1 knockdown in breast cancer cell lines , real-time PCR arrays were used to analyze transcription of 84 genes implicated in cancer .
Only genes with greater than two @-@ fold change were considered .
Three genes ( <i> MAP2K1 </i> , <i> VEGF </i> , <i> PDGFA </i> ) were altered two @-@ fold or more after MUC1 siRNA in both MDA @-@ MB-468 and BT-20 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) ; two genes ( <i> ITGAV </i> , <i> MMP2 </i> ) changed only in 468.siMUC1 ; and five genes ( <i> TIMP3 </i> , <i> RAF1 </i> , <i> JUN </i> , <i> TNF </i> , <i> CDC25A </i> ) only in BT.siMUC1 .
This list represents all genes affected greater than two @-@ fold after MUC1 siRNA , rather than a select group .
Three genes whose transcription was changed by less than two @-@ fold are shown , two of which ( <i> PDGFB </i> and <i> ITGB1 </i> ) are listed because they relate closely to genes altered by two @-@ fold ( <i> PDGFA </i> and <i> ITGAV </i> ) .
The third , <i> MYC </i> , is included because western blots confirmed a substantial change at the protein level ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3a </xref> ) that may reflect both transcriptional and post @-@ transcriptional regulation .
Interestingly , transcription of <i> MAP2K1 </i> was decreased in both cell lines after MUC1 siRNA .
This gene encodes MEK1 , one of the primary regulators of the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAPK pathway [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"> 33 </xref>@ ] , a network that has been linked several times to MUC1 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"> 12 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"> 36 </xref>@ ] .
We examined MEK1 and MEK2 levels by western blot to confirm decreased protein in MUC1 siRNA @-@ treated cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3a </xref> ) , and found that not only were total MEK1 @/@ MEK2 levels lower in 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 compared to controls ( 0.48 and 0.68 relative to siLuc , respectively ) , but so were the basal amounts of active ( phosphorylated ) MEK1 @/@ MEK2 ( pMEK1 @/@ pMEK2 ; 0.12 and 0.42 relative to siLuc , respectively ) .
Both 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 also showed reduced activation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( dpERK1 @/@ dpERK2 ; 0.21 and 0.27 relative to siLuc , respectively ) , as would be expected with diminished signaling through MEK1 @/@ MEK2 ; total ERK1 @/@ ERK2 levels remain unchanged .
As both lines have high levels of EGFR and thus activate the MEK @-@ ERK cascade intensely when stimulated with EGF [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref>@ ] , siRNA @-@ transfected cells were treated with EGF .
Notably , MUC1 siRNA impairs this important oncogenic pathway in MDA @-@ MB-468 cells , as 468.siMUC1 display less pMEK1 @/@ pMEK2 in response to EGF than do 468.siLuc ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3b </xref> ) .
Interestingly , EGF treatment of BT-20 cells results in slightly higher pMEK1 @/@ pMEK2 levels in BT.siMUC1 compared to BT.siLuc .
Though this result seems paradoxical in light of decreased <i> MAP2K1 </i> transcription in BT.siMUC1 , it likely results from differential functions of Raf isoforms in combination with the increased <i> RAF1 </i> transcription ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) and protein level ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3a </xref> ) in these cells .
Specifically , B-Raf is thought to be the main activator of MEK under normal conditions ; Raf-1 activates MEK in response to stimulus [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"> 38 </xref>@ ] .
Thus , it appears that basal pMEK1 @/@ pMEK2 levels are not greatly affected by Raf-1 overexpression in BT.siMUC1 cells , likely because MEK is regulated primarily by B-Raf under normal growth conditions .
In contrast , when the cells are stimulated ( EGF ) , increased Raf-1 levels in BT.siMUC1 leads to heightened pMEK1 @/@ pMEK2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3b </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> MUC1 siRNA increases apoptosis in MDA @-@ MB-468 but not BT-20 </sec-title>
We next examined whether MUC1 knockdown and its associated transcriptional alterations would affect overall cellular events .
As several of the genes shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> are important in regulating proliferation and survival , and because of the recently described role of MUC1 in modulating apoptosis in response to cellular stresses [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] , we first analyzed whether MUC1 siRNA would alter apoptosis in these lines .
Although there was no change in basal apoptosis in either line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4a </xref> ) , we observed that the cell lines responded differently when trypsinized for re @-@ plating 24 hours after transfection ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4b </xref> ) .
Interestingly , 468.siMUC1 cells show greater apoptosis after trypsinization than do 468.siLuc ( 49.8 % versus 34.0 % , respectively ) , while BT-20 cells from both siRNA treatments display similar levels of apoptosis ( around 22 % ) .
To examine whether this phenomenon is specific to trypsin treatment or part of a general stress response involving MUC1 , we subjected cells to a panel of stresses and measured cell death .
In agreement with the patterns seen with trypsinization , BT.siLuc and BT.siMUC1 respond similarly to all treatments ( data not shown ) , while 468.siMUC1 die more readily than 468.siLuc in response to trypsin , G418 , hydrogen peroxide , or celecoxib , a chemotherapeutic that targets the cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) pathway ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4c </xref> ) ; these data were confirmed with two independent siRNA constructs ( data not shown ) .
Like the MAPK pathway , AKT signaling has been linked to MUC1 in cancer .
Although transcription of <i> AKT </i> was not altered in MUC1 siRNA @-@ treated cells , the results of our apoptosis studies prompted us to investigate levels of AKT further .
As expected , the total AKT protein level is not greatly changed after MUC1 siRNA in either cell line , though the active form ( pAKT ) is increased in both 468.siMUC1 and BT.siMUC1 compared to controls ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3a </xref> ) .
This result disagrees with MUC1 activation of the AKT pathway in rat 3Y1 cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"> 18 </xref>@ ] , and may reflect regulation more appropriate to breast cancer cells ; this is supported by activation of AKT in response to MUC1 siRNA in other lines [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
In addition , there is a striking difference in the relative amounts of AKT and pAKT in the two cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4d </xref> ) .
When lysates from both lines are exposed to film for the same length of time ( overexposure masks the differences between BT.siLuc and BT.siMUC1 that are apparent in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3a </xref> ) , it is clear that pAKT levels are much higher in BT-20 than in MDA @-@ MB-468 , despite lower total AKT expression .
This difference in AKT activation between MDA @-@ MB-468 and BT-20 likely contributes to the disparity in their sensitivity to the increased apoptosis expected with loss of MUC1 .
<sec-title level="2"> MUC1 siRNA alters proliferation and invasion </sec-title>
As MUC1 is involved in apoptosis , we next analyzed its effects on proliferation .
BrdU and [ @<sup> 3 </sup>@ H ] thymidine incorporation were used to analyze proliferation after MUC1 siRNA .
468.siMUC1 cells show a significant decrease in [ @<sup> 3 </sup>@ H ] thymidine incorporation compared to 468.siLuc , while intriguingly , BT.siMUC1 cells show a significant increase in proliferation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5a </xref> ) .
Growth curves mirror these results , as do experiments with the two independent MUC1 siRNA oligonucleotides ( data not shown ) .
Note that these assays require trypsinizing cells 24 hours post @-@ transfection ; therefore , the results in the MDA @-@ MB-468 line could stem from the changes in apoptosis described in the previous section , rather than a true effect on proliferation .
To control for this , we incubated non @-@ trypsinized , siRNA @-@ transfected cells at similar confluence with BrdU to measure incorporation .
The ' clumped ' profile of cells ( contrast to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4b </xref> ) is likely a result of the acid denaturation ( recommended by the antibody manufacturer ) , as it occurs uniformly in these experiments .
BrdU incorporation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5b </xref> ) confirms that the [ @<sup> 3 </sup>@ H ] thymidine results are not solely due to alterations in apoptosis , as 468.siMUC1 cells incorporate less BrdU than 468.siLuc ; once again , BT.siMUC1 cells show increased proliferation over BT.siLuc .
Given the role of MUC1 in adhesion , we examined whether MUC1 siRNA affects cellular invasion .
In transwell assays , BT-20 cells invaded poorly , regardless of the siRNA used ( data not shown ) .
However , MDA @-@ MB-468 cells invade more readily , and were analyzed on a panel of three different extracellular matrix proteins .
Interestingly , 468.siMUC1 cells display somewhat decreased invasion on collagen IV , laminin , and fibronectin matrices , and on a no @-@ matrix control ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5c </xref> ) , which is in agreement with the trend towards decreased metastasis observed in Muc1 @<sup> -/- </sup> × MMTV @-@ PyV MT mice [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref>@ ] .
<sec-title level="2"> Transfection of MUC1 rescues the 468.siMUC1 phenotype </sec-title>
To determine if the above effects are specific to MUC1 , we created stable transfectants of the MDA @-@ MB-468 line using empty vector ( 468.Neo ) or a full @-@ length MUC1 construct ( 468.MUC1Δ8 ) that is resistant to one of the independent MUC1 @-@ directed oligonucleotides ( ' 882 ' ) .
These cells were maintained in G418 @-@ containing medium to retain transgene selection .
As expected , 468.MUC1Δ8 cells show higher levels of both the MUC1 extracellular domain and the MUC1 @-@ CT than do 468.Neo ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6a </xref> ) .
Note that 468.Neo have MUC1 expression comparable to parental MDA @-@ MB-468 ; the exposures in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6a </xref> are lighter than those in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1a </xref> , in order to clearly show the relative levels of MUC1 in the stable transfectants .
After MUC1 siRNA , 468.MUC1Δ8 lose some MUC1 ( likely endogenous protein , which is not siRNA @-@ resistant ) but retain high @-@ level expression , while 468.Neo show a decrease in MUC1 levels similar to parental 468.siMUC1 cells ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6a , b </xref> ) .
The difference in the amount of MUC1 knockdown between 468.Neo and 468.MUC1Δ8 is highlighted by the purple shading in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6b </xref>@ .
BrdU incorporation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6c </xref> ) indicates that 468.Neo show decreased nucleotide incorporation after MUC1 siRNA compared to control ( 3.3 % versus 25.0 % , respectively ) ; this is not seen in 468.MUC1Δ8 cells , which show similar levels of BrdU incorporation regardless of the siRNA used ( 21.5 % for luciferase , 23.9 % for MUC1 ) .
468.Neo cells display a more dramatic decrease in BrdU incorporation after MUC1 siRNA than what is seen in parental 468.siMUC1 cells , which may reflect the additional stress of being maintained in G418 @-@ containing medium .
Similarly , analysis of apoptosis in trypsinized cells indicates that the increased apoptosis seen in parental 468.siMUC1 cells is also present in the 468.Neo line after MUC1 siRNA ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6d </xref> ; 43.6 % in control versus 59.6 % in MUC1 siRNA ) .
However , in 468.MUC1Δ8 cells , the level of apoptosis after luciferase siRNA ( 34.1 % ) is lower than that in 468.Neo cells ; MUC1 siRNA increases the amount of apoptosis slightly ( 42.8 % ) , restoring it to a level similar to that seen in luciferase siRNA @-@ treated 468.Neo cells .
Together , these studies suggest that the above @-@ described results are specific to MUC1 , as stable transfection of an siRNA @-@ resistant MUC1 rescues the phenotype seen in 468.siMUC1 cells .
TDAG51 is an ERK signaling target that opposes ERK @-@ mediated HME16C mammary epithelial cell transformation ( PMID : 18597688 )
Results
Activation of both the ERK and PI3K signaling pathways was sufficient to induce cellular transformation , which was accompanied by up-regulation of EGFR ligands , suggesting autocrine EGFR stimulation during the transformation process .
Only activation of the ERK pathway was sufficient to transform cells in the presence of EGFR inhibition and was sufficient for tumorigenesis in xenografts .
Up-regulation of the PHLDA1 gene product , TDAG51 , was found to correlate with persistent ERK activation and anchorage @-@ independent growth in the absence or presence of EGFR inhibition .
Knockdown of this putative breast cancer tumor @-@ suppressor gene resulted in increased ERK pathway activation and enhanced matrix @-@ detached cellular proliferation of Ras @/@ Raf transformed cells .

Generation of H-Ras @- and Rlf @-@ CAAX @-@ expressing HME16C cell lines
Retroviral vectors coding for amino terminal HA @-@ tagged activated H-RasV12 , the H-RasV12 effector domain mutants ( EDM ) H-RasV12G37 , H-RasV12S35 , and H-RasV12C40 , and the constitutively activated version of a RalGEF , Rlf @-@ CAAX , were used to infect telomerase immortalized HME16C human mammary epithelial cells .
Anti @-@ Ras and anti @-@ HA western blotting demonstrated approximately equal levels of ectopic Ras expression among Ras @-@ infected cells , with slightly lower levels in HME16C RasV12 @-@ infected cells relative to EDM @-@ infected cells ( Figure 1A ) .
Analysis of activated , GTP @-@ bound Ral A demonstrated highly elevated levels of activated Ral A only in Rlf @-@ CAAX @-@ expressing cells and not in Ras @-@ infected cells grown under standard culture conditions ( Figure 1B ) .
To assess activation of the ERK pathway , anti @-@ phospho Erk western blotting was performed and showed significantly elevated Erk phosphoprotein in RasV12 @- and RasV12S35 @-@ infected HME16C cells relative to control pLRT @-@ infected cells ( Figure 1A ) .
Elevated levels of phosphorylated Erk were also observed in RasV12G37 @- and RasV12C40 @-@ infected cells , although at a much lower level than that found in RasV12 @- and RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells .
To assess activation of the PI3K signaling pathway , anti @-@ phosphoAkt ( Ser473 ) western blotting was performed to detect activated , phosphorylated Akt .
In cells that were serum starved for 24 hours and matrix detached for 6 hours , elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt were observed in RasV12-, RasV12C40-, and RasV12G37 @-@ infected HME16C , with highest levels present in RasV12 @-@ infected cells ( Figure 1C ) .
Anchorage @-@ independent growth of mammary epithelial cell lines
To assess transformation by different Ras signaling pathways , anchorage @-@ independent growth assays were performed in soft agar and in ultra @-@ low attachment tissue culture plates .
Ras @- and Ras EDM @-@ infected HME16C cells formed significantly more soft agar colonies > 100 μm in diameter than pLRT vector @-@ infected cells ( Figure 2A ) .
The RasV12 @-@ infected cells formed large colonies , many exceeding 1000 μm , although the total number exceeding 100 μm was typically less than that for the Ras EDM ( Figure 2B ) .
Among the Ras EDM @-@ infected cells , the RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells formed the largest colonies .
These were similar to , but smaller than , the RasV12 @-@ infected cells .
For colonies above 100 μm in diameter , RasV12C40 @-@ infected cells were the most efficient at colony formation , despite the smaller mean size of colonies .
Rlf @-@ CAAX @-@ infected cells formed slightly more colonies above 100 μm than vector @-@ transfected control cells , but these were significantly smaller than those formed by Ras @- and Ras EDM @-@ infected cells .
When grown under anchorage @-@ independent conditions in ultra @-@ low attachment plates , the accumulation of cells for the various infected cell lines roughly paralleled the total cell masses seen in soft agar growth assays ( Figure 2C ) .
The RasV12 @- and RasV12 EDM @-@ expressing cells grew well , while the growth of the Rlf @-@ CAAX @-@ expressing cells was significantly less .
The HME16C cells maintained viability but did not increase in number .
To compare our results to others , we verified the function of pLRT vector driven Ras EDM mutants and Rlf @-@ CAAX in HEK @-@ HT cells , which previously have been reported to form colonies in soft agar upon expression of H-RasV12G37 and Rlf @-@ CAAX [ 27 ] .
In our hands , expression of H-RasV12 , H-RasV12G37 , and Rlf @-@ CAAX from the pLRT vector induced efficient soft agar colony growth , and H-RasV12S35 and H-RasV12C40 did not ( not shown ) , identical to previously reported results [ 27 ] .
Expression of exogenous H-Ras and Rlf @-@ CAAX , and activation of endogenous RalA , in this cell line was similar to that observed in HME16C cells ( not shown ) .
Therefore , expression of Rlf @-@ CAAX and subsequent RalA activation did not appear to be sufficient to induce anchorage @-@ independent growth in the HME16C mammary epithelial cell line in contrast to HEK @-@ HT and various other immortalized human cell types [ 27 ] .
Tumorigenesis of HME16C cell lines in nude mice
Anchorage @-@ independent growth often predicts the ability of cells to grow as xenografted tumors in immuno @-@ compromised mice .
Tumor formation was assessed following subcutaneous inoculation .
The RasV12 @-@ infected HME16C cells formed rapidly growing , fluid @-@ filled tumors with an average latency of 4 weeks and a mean tumor volume of 808.8 mm3 at 6 weeks ( Table 1 ) .
Approximately one @-@ half of the tumors were aspirated prior to sacrifice , and a sero @-@ sanguinous fluid was observed , on average accounting for roughly one @-@ third of the measured tumor volume .
Histological analysis of H&E stained tumor sections revealed poorly differentiated spindle @-@ shaped tumor cells with prominent squamous cell differentiation and extracellular keratin deposition ( not shown ) .
Tumors also contained a strong inflammatory component .
Of the other cell lines tested , only the RasV12S35 @-@ infected HME16C cells formed palpable tumors in 50 % of injected animals with an average latency of approximately 12 weeks and a mean tumor volume of 109.0 mm3 at 16 weeks , considerably smaller than RasV12 @-@ expressing tumors ( Table 1 ) .
Cells within RasV12S35 @-@ infected tumors resembled the histology of RasV12 tumor cells but with less keratin deposition and without the formation of fluid @-@ filled spaces ( not shown ) .
Empty vector-, RasV12G37-, RasV12C40-, and Rlf @-@ CAAX @-@ infected cells failed to form palpable tumors four months after injection .
The metastatic potential of RasV12 @- and RasV12G37 @-@ expressing cell lines was tested by tail @-@ vein injection in nude mice , but no metastatic lesions were observed by histological analysis in lungs , liver , spleen , or kidneys at 16 weeks post injection ( not shown ) .
Autocrine EGFR signaling is required for RasV12G37 @- and RasV12C40 @-@ mediated , but not RasV12S35 @-@ mediated , HME16C cell anchorage @- independent growth
EGFR signaling is frequently altered in breast cancer , where EGFR and ErbB2 over-expression are common events .
cDNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis of HME16C RasV12 @- and Ras EDM @-@ infected cells ( Additional file 1 ) revealed increased levels of mRNAs for EGFR ligands , including epiregulin , amphiregulin , and TGFa ( Table 2 ) .
In addition , increased levels of phospho @-@ Erk were unexpectedly seen in RasV12G37 @- and RasV12C40 @-@ infected cells , possibly the result of autocrine activation of endogenous EGFR by secreted EGFR ligands .
The presence of EGFR was established using Western blots ( not shown ) .
Therefore , we sought to determine if autocrine signaling by the EGFR was required for the anchorage @-@ independent growth of Ras @- or Ras EDM @-@ infected cells .
RasV12 @- and Ras EDM @-@ infected HME16C cells were grown in soft agar in the presence or absence of the EGFR @-@ specific inhibitors , PD153035 and PD168393 .
Complete inhibition of colony formation for RasV12G37 @-@ infected and RasV12C40 @-@ infected cells was observed at 0.25 μM PD153035 , a concentration that specifically inhibits EGFR [ 28 ] , whereas both the RasV12 @- and RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells formed colonies efficiently at this same concentration of inhibitor ( Figure 3A and 3B ) .
Identical results were found for the EGFR @-@ specific inhibitor PD168393 used at 0.1 μM , a concentration that specifically inhibits EGFR and Her-2 receptors [ 29 ] ( not shown ) .
Similarly , treatment of cells grown in ultra @-@ low @-@ attachment plates also demonstrated that EGFR inhibition substantially inhibited growth of RasV12G37 @-@ and RasV12C40 @-@ expressing cells relative to that of RasV12 @- and RasV12S35 @-@ expressing HME16C ( Figure 2C ) .
Western blotting of cellular lysates from cells treated with 0.25 μM PD153035 showed that high levels of phosphorylated Erk were maintained only in RasV12 @- and RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells , but were significantly reduced in RasV12G37 @- or RasV12C40 @-@ infected cells treated with the inhibitor ( Figure 3C ) , while phoshorylated Akt was minimally affected ( not shown ) .
Anchorage @-@ independent growth therefore correlated with maintenance of high Erk activity in HME16C cells .
Consistent with this observation , inhibition of MEK , and therefore ERK signaling , using the MEK @-@ specific inhibitor PD98059 at 10 μM , significantly inhibited soft agar colony formation by all cell lines ( not shown ) .
Microarray analysis of gene expression changes in RasV12-, RasV12G37-, RasV12S35-, and RasV12C40 @-@ infected HME16C cells
Activation of the Ras oncogene is accompanied by the stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the activation or repression of numerous transcription factors as well as changes in mRNA translation and stability , and thus , the modulation of gene expression .
To determine which gene expression changes accompany the transformation of HME16C human epithelial cells by activated Ras , we examined our transformed HME16C cells by cDNA microarray analysis .
To do this , RNA was isolated from H-RasV12 and H-RasV12 EDM expressing cells after treatment with doxycycline to fully induce gene expression and compared to RNA from identically treated pLRT vector @-@ infected control cells .
Statistical analysis of microarray ( SAM ) data analysis was performed for the datasets , and a delta value of 0.4 was chosen for each dataset , which maintains the estimated false discovery rate ( FDR ) below 1 % for each .
A summary of the genes up @- or down-regulated greater than 2 @-@ fold in the H-RasV12 @- and Ras effector domain mutant @-@ infected HME16C cell lines is presented in Additional file 1 , organized according to broad categories of gene function .
To validate gene expression changes identified by cDNA microarray analysis , quantitative RT-PCR was performed using RNA from the same samples used in microarray analysis , and is presented in Additional file 2 .
Results for 22 of 26 genes chosen to reflect genes up @- or down-regulated both strongly or weakly showed strong agreement with microarray data , demonstrating that the microarray dataset represents a reliable quantification of gene expression changes .
To evaluate the effect of EGFR inhibition on gene expression , RasV12-, RasV12S35-, and RasV12G37 @-@ infected cells were induced with doxycycline and subsequently incubated either in the presence or absence of 0.25 μM PD153035 , and microarray analysis comparisons were made to vehicle @-@ treated pLRT @-@ infected cells .
Almost all Ras and Ras EDM @-@ induced upregulated transcriptional responses were blocked by pharmacological inhibition of EGFR , consistent with previous reports for inhibition of Raf @-@ regulated transcription [ 30 ] .
Our analysis identified PHLDA1 as an up-regulated gene in both vehicle @-@ treated and PD153035 @-@ treated RasV12 and RasV12S35 cells , although the relative fold increase was reduced following EGFR inhibition .
By comparison , PHLDA1 was down-regulated in PD153035 @-@ treated RasV12G37 relative to vehicle @-@ treated cells ( not shown ) .
Therefore , PHLDA1 represents a Raf @/@ ERK @-@ responsive gene whose expression parallels EGFR @-@ independent HME16C mammary epithelial cell transformation .
TDAG51 expression is up-regulated by Ras signaling in a ERK @-@ dependent manner , and is associated with EGFR @-@ independent transformation
The PHLDA1 gene is of interest as it has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor in breast adenocarcinoma and melanoma [ 17,18 ] .
We further analyzed the signal dependent expression of the PHLDA1 gene and its protein product , TDAG51 .
Microarray analysis identified the PHLDA1 gene as being dramatically up-regulated in RasV12 @- and Ras EDM @-@ infected cells to levels that correlated with the level of ERK activation and the extent of anchorage @-@ independent growth ( Additional file 1 ) .
Western blotting confirmed that TDAG51 was also upregulated in a similar manner ( Figure 4A ) .
The PHLDA1 gene was elevated in PD153035 @-@ treated RasV12 @- and RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells but was significantly dependent upon EGFR tyrosine kinase activity for upregulation in RasV12G37 @- and RasV12C40 @-@ infected cells ( not shown ) , and the expression of the encoded TDAG51 protein approximately paralleled PHLDA1 RNA expression ( Figure 4B ) .
As shown in Figure 3C , EGFR inhibition significantly reduced ERK signaling in RasV12G37 @- and RasV12C40 @-@ infected cells without affecting RasV12 @- and RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells .
To confirm that TDAG51 up-regulation was induced specifically by ERK activation , we treated pLRT-, RasV12-, and RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells with the MEK @-@ specific inhibitor PD98059 .
PD98059 used at 20 μM appears to be specific for MEK1 as it does not nonspecifically inhibit a variety of other protein kinases that have been assayed .
[ 31 ] .
TDAG51 up-regulation was attenuated by MEK inhibition ( Figure 5 ) .
TDAG51 therefore represents an ERK @-@ inducible gene whose up-regulation in HME16C is correlated with an EGFR @-@ independent , ERK @-@ mediated transformation .
TDAG51 up-regulation opposes ERK @-@ mediated HME16C transformation
To analyze the role of TDAG51 in ERK @-@ dependent growth , we reduced TDAG51 expression in RasV12 @- and RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells to a level comparable to that in non @-@ transformed vector @-@ infected control cells using stably expressed TDAG51 @-@ specific shRNA ( Figure 6A ) .
Cell proliferation of attached cells grown on tissue culture plastic was unaffected by lowered TDAG51 protein levels ( not shown ) .
However , cell growth under anchorage @-@ independent conditions in ultra @-@ low attachment plates was significantly enhanced by TDAG51 knock-down in RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells ( Figure 6B ) .
Likewise , results with RasV12 @-@ infected cells stably infected with TDAG51 @-@ targeting shRNA also showed enhanced growth relative to vector @-@ infected control cells , although to a lesser extent than that seen with RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells ( Figure 6C ) .
This suggests that Ras signaling pathways other than ERK compensate partially for the negative growth effects of TDAG51 , or that RasV12 @-@ infected cells are already close to maximally transformed under anchorage @-@ independent growth conditions .
Loss of TDAG51 expression in transformed cells stimulates both cell cycle progression and apoptosis
To characterize the effect of TDAG51 on cell proliferation under anchorage @-@ independent conditions , cell cycle analysis and cell proliferation assays for RasV12S35 @- and RasV12 @-@ infected cells were performed .
Both RasV12S35 @- and RasV12 @- TDAG51 shRNA @-@ expressing cells demonstrated an increased S-phase fraction versus pLVTHM vector control cells at various time points during anchorage @-@ independent growth ( Figure 7A ) .
In concordance with these results , RasV12S35 and RasV12 cells expressing the TDAG51 @-@ specific shRNA showed enhanced incorporation of 5 @-@ ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine ( EdU ) in cell proliferation assays , indicating a higher rate of DNA synthesis in cells with reduced TDAG51 protein ( Figure 7C ) .
Since cell growth under anchorage @-@ independent conditions is a balance between cell proliferation and cell death , we sought to evaluate the effect upon cellular death of TDAG51 knock-down .
We used an assay of cellular cytotoxicity that measures the release of the lactose deydrogenase enzyme , LDH .
LDH release was increased by TDAG51 shRNA @-@ expressing RasV12S35 cells relative to pLVTHM @-@ infected cells at various time points after the initiation of matrix @-@ detached growth ( Figure 8 ) .
The difference in LDH release for TDAG51 shRNA @-@ expressing RasV12 cells was minimal and rarely approached statistical significance .
Sub @-@ G1 peaks indicative of dead cells were sometimes seen with cell cycle analysis at late time points , but varied from experiment to experiment .
Therefore , for RasV12S35 @-@ infected cells , the differences in cell growth after TDAG51 reduction under anchorage @-@ independent conditions resulted from an enhanced rate of cellular proliferation that exceeded a concomitant increase in cell death .
Reduction of TDAG51 in transformed cells enhances proximal ERK signaling
Reducing TDAG51 protein levels in ERK @-@ driven cellular transformation enhanced cell growth under anchorage @-@ independent , but not attached , conditions .
To test whether TDAG51 might affect proximal ERK signaling , we examined the activation status of Erk in cells expressing TDAG51 @-@ specific shRNA .
Interestingly , the levels of phosphorylated Erk were enhanced when TDAG51 protein levels were reduced in RasV12S35 and RasV12 cells grown under anchorage @-@ independent , but not attached , conditions ( Figure 9 ) .
The fact that the activation status of Erk was unchanged in cells grown under attached conditions suggests that reducing TDAG51 expression had no selective effect with regard to ERK activation in these cells .
Rather , the enhanced activation of Erk was specific to anchorage @-@ independent growth conditions .
Activation of MEK1 or MEK2 isoform is sufficient to fully transform intestinal epithelial cells and induce the formation of metastatic tumors ( PMID : 19014680 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
We found that expression of activated MEK1 or MEK2 is sufficient to morphologically transform intestinal epithelial cells , dysregulate cell proliferation and induce the formation of high @-@ grade adenocarcinomas after orthotopic transplantation in mice .
A large proportion of these intestinal tumors metastasize to the liver and lung .
Mechanistically , activation of MEK1 or MEK2 up-regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases , promotes invasiveness and protects cells from undergoing anoikis .
Importantly , we show that silencing of MEK2 expression completely suppresses the proliferation of human colon carcinoma cell lines , whereas inactivation of MEK1 has a much weaker effect .

<sec-title level="2"> Constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 is sufficient for transformation of intestinal epithelial cells and formation of tumors <i> in vivo </i> </sec-title>
Immunohistochemistry analysis of a colorectal cancer tissue microarray containing over 400 colorectal cancer and 50 normal colon tissue biopsies revealed that 44 % of colorectal cancers display high cytoplasmic expression of phosphorylated MEK1 @/@ MEK2 as compared to 10 % of normal tissues ( analysis to be published elsewhere ) .
To assess the functional significance of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 activation in colorectal cancer , we ectopically expressed wild type and constitutively active ( DD mutant ) versions of MEK1 and MEK2 by retroviral gene transfer in the normal undifferentiated intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] .
Polyclonal populations of infected clones were selected in puromycin and used for subsequent experiments .
Immunoblot analysis confirmed that ectopic MEK isoforms are expressed at comparable levels in IEC-6 transduced populations ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) .
Overexpression of wild type MEK1 or MEK2 did not affect the expression of endogenous MEK isoforms .
However , ectopic expression or MEK2DD slightly increased the steady @-@ state levels of endogenous MEK1 , while overexpression of MEK1DD had a similar effect on MEK2 levels ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> ) .
As expected , substitution of the activation loop Ser phosphorylation sites by Asp residues strongly potentiated the enzymatic activity of MEK1 and MEK2 , but no reproducible difference in activity was observed between the two isoforms ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> ) .
IEC-6 cells grow as a monolayer and display a typical epithelial morphology with organized cell @-@ cell adhesions ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> ) .
Overexpression of wild type MEK isoforms had no noticeable effect on the morphology of IEC-6 cells .
In contrast , expression of activated MEK1 or MEK2 led to drastic morphological changes accompanied by loss of cell @-@ cell contacts ; the cells adopted a spindle @-@ like fibroblast morphology , were more refractile and formed multilayers .
These changes are characteristic of epithelial @-@ mesenchymal transitions ( EMT ) that play an important role in tumor progression [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"> 39 </xref>@ ] .
To determine whether MEK1DD @- and MEK2DD @-@ expressing cells undergo an EMT , we examined the localization and measured the expression levels of various epithelial and mesenchymal markers .
Parental and vector @-@ infected IEC-6 cells showed a polarized basolateral membrane distribution of the epithelial marker E-cadherin , with basal expression of the fibroblast marker vimentin ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1E </xref> ) .
Ectopic expression of MEK1DD or MEK2DD resulted in the loss of E-cadherin staining at the plasma membrane ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1E </xref> ) , concomitant with a marked reduction of E-cadherin protein and mRNA levels ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1F </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1G </xref> ) .
No significant change in the expression of keratins and no induction of the mesenchymal proteins vimentin and smooth muscle α-actin ( we instead observed a decreased expression ) were observed in these cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1F </xref> ) .
These results indicate that constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 , while disrupting normal epithelial morphology and polarization , is not sufficient to induce a full EMT in intestinal epithelial cells .
This epithelial plasticity change has been referred to as scattering and is distinct from EMT [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"> 40 </xref>@ ] .
We examined whether constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 was conferring some proliferation advantage to intestinal epithelial cells .
Ectopic expression of either activated MEK1 or MEK2 significantly increased the proliferation rate of IEC-6 cells grown in 10 % serum containing @-@ medium when compared to vector @-@ infected cells or cells overexpressing wild type MEK isoforms ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
This increase in proliferation was not observed in low serum ( 2 % ) containing @-@ medium ( data not shown ) .
Both activated MEK1 and MEK2 conferred anchorage @-@ independence growth to IEC-6 cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> ) .
To test the tumorigenic potential of IEC-6 transduced cell populations <i> in vivo </i> , the cells were injected subcutaneously into athymic mice .
Cells infected with vector or wild type MEK isoforms never formed any tumor ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> ) .
In contrast , both MEK1DD @- and MEK2DD @-@ expressing cells generated rapidly growing tumors in all injected mice .
Injection of as low as 3 × 10 @<sup> 4 </sup> cells produced tumors of ~ 1,000 mm @<sup> 3 </sup> after 2 weeks .
No major difference was observed in the growth rate of tumors expressing activated MEK1 or MEK2 ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2D </xref> ) .
To analyze the impact of active MEK isoforms on tumorigenesis in a more pathologically relevant model , IEC-6 transduced cells were orthotopically transplanted into the caecum of athymic mice .
This model more closely recapitulates human colorectal cancer progression , in particular the spontaneous metastatic process that is highly dependent on the host environment [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"> 41 </xref>@ ] .
Strikingly , 100 % of the mice transplanted with 10 @<sup> 5 </sup> IEC-6 cells expressing either MEK1DD or MEK2DD developed massive intestinal tumors , while the control group remained tumor @-@ free ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2E </xref> ) .
The mice were sacrificed when they became moribund or presented symptoms of weight loss , respiratory distress , or a palpable abdominal mass .
Microscopic examination of the tumors revealed a poorly differentiated morphology with occasional signet @-@ ring cells ( inset ) corresponding to a high @-@ grade adenocarcinoma ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2E </xref> ) .
The tumors are invasive and diffusely infiltrate the lamina propria and the underlying muscular layers ( muscularis propria and muscularis mucosae ) .
Together , these data demonstrate that constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 is sufficient to transform intestinal epithelial cells and induce the formation of invasive colon adenocarcinomas .
<sec-title level="2"> Constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 confers metastatic properties to transformed intestinal epithelial cells </sec-title>
Activation of the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in the regulation of cell motility and invasion [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"> 42 </xref>@ ] .
Notably , treatment of colon carcinoma cells with the MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor PD184352 was shown to inhibit HGF @-@ induced cell scattering and to reduce their invasive properties [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
We examined the impact of MEK1 or MEK2 activation on the motility of IEC-6 cells using two different cell migration assays .
No difference in the migration rate of the different IEC-6 transduced populations was observed in a standard chemotaxis assay with serum as chemoattractant ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
Similar results were obtained using a wound @-@ healing assay ( data not shown ) .
We next analyzed the ability of the cells to migrate through a Matrigel @-@ coated membrane as a reflection of their invasive properties .
Ectopic expression of activated MEK1 or MEK2 significantly enhanced the invasive capacity of IEC-6 cells , while the wild type MEK isoforms had no effect ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
Interestingly , the MEK2DD @-@ transduced cells appeared more invasive than cells expressing MEK1DD in this assay .
The invasive properties of the cells <i> in vitro </i> and the histology of the intestinal tumors suggest that MEK1DD @- and MEK2DD @-@ expressing IEC-6 cells may have metastatic properties <i> in vivo </i>@ .
Detailed histological examination of a subset of mice that develop orthotopic tumors revealed the presence of metastasis in the lymph nodes , the lungs and the liver in both the MEK1DD and MEK2DD groups ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3C </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3D </xref> ) .
These observations indicate that constitutive activation of either MEK1 or MEK2 is sufficient to confer a metastatic phenotype to intestinal tumor cells .
The acquisition of invasiveness does not result from changes in cellular motility .
To identify downstream targets of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 involved in intestinal tumor progression , we analyzed the transcriptional profile of MEK1DD @- and MEK2DD @-@ expressing IEC-6 cells using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays .
Analysis of the gene expression data identified several genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated in MEK1DD @- and MEK2DD @-@ expressing cells as compared to control IEC-6 cells ( Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref> ) .
The list of modulated genes included growth factors , signaling molecules , drug metabolism enzymes and , interestingly , several proteases .
The matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) MMP-3 and MMP-13 were up-regulated in both MEK1DD @- and MEK2DD @-@ expressing cells , while up-regulation of MMP-10 reached significance only in MEK2DD cells .
Expression of the urokinase receptor was also up-regulated in IEC-6 cells expressing activated MEK2 .
Because of the importance of MMPs and urokinase receptor in tumor progression [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43"> 43 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"> 44 </xref>@ ] , we further validated the regulation of these genes by MEK1 and MEK2 signaling to confirm the data from the arrays .
No expression or activity of MMPs could be detected in empty vector @-@ infected IEC-6 cells .
However , activation of either MEK1 or MEK2 markedly up-regulated the expression of MMP-13 protein ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) .
Notably , higher levels of MMP-13 protein were detected in IEC-6 cells expressing the activated MEK2 isoform .
The expression of MMP-3 @/@ MMP-10 was analyzed by measuring their activity by zymography in casein @-@ containing gels .
Again , we observed that MEK2DD increased MMP-3 @/@ MMP-10 enzymatic activity more robustly than MEK1DD ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) .
Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 induces the expression of urokinase receptor mRNA ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
As observed for the MMPs , the extent of induction of the urokinase receptor gene was higher in MEK2DD @-@ expressing cells .
In a previous study , Komatsu et al. [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"> 45 </xref>@ ] have used oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze the gene expression profile of intestinal epithelial cells expressing a conditional allele of activated MEK1 .
We have compared the results of our transcriptional profiling analysis with this study .
Of the 69 gene transcripts that showed altered expression in the study of Komatsu , 18 ( 26 % ) were found to be modulated in IEC-6 cells expressing constitutively active MEK1 or MEK2 .
Importantly , the two studies converge on a series of genes involved in cell proliferation , cell invasion , tumor suppression and drug metabolism .
<sec-title level="2"> Constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 protects intestinal epithelial cells against anoikis </sec-title>
Epithelial cancer progression and metastasis is associated with the acquisition of resistance to anoikis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"> 46 </xref>@ ] .
To further explore the mechanism by which MEK1 and MEK2 promote tumor metastasis , we asked whether activated MEK isoforms protect intestinal epithelial cells from cell death induced by loss of adhesion .
IEC-6 @-@ transduced populations were placed on poly @-@ HEMA @-@ coated plates in normal growth medium and the extent of apoptosis was measured at different times by TUNEL .
Detachment from matrix induced high levels of apoptosis of control IEC-6 cells , which was already detectable at 6 h and increased up to 24 h ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> ) .
Strikingly , expression of either MEK1DD or MEK2DD almost completely protected IEC-6 cells from undergoing anoikis .
As a step to understand the molecular mechanism by which activated MEK isoforms suppress anoikis , we monitored the expression of Bcl-2 anti @-@ apoptotic and pro @-@ apoptotic family proteins .
Constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 resulted in the up-regulation of the pro @-@ survival proteins Mcl-1 , Bcl-2 and , to a lesser extent , Bcl-x @<sub> L </sub> in IEC-6 cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> ) .
Our results confirm and extend previous observations [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47"> 47 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48"> 48 </xref>@ ] by demonstrating that both MEK1 and MEK2 isoforms share the property to induce the accumulation of Bcl-2 family pro @-@ survival members .
Reciprocally , induction of the BH3 @-@ only pro @-@ apoptotic protein Bim was completely suppressed in cells expressing MEK1DD or MEK2DD ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5C </xref> ) .
This finding is consistent with previous reports documenting the role of the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAP kinase pathway in promoting the degradation of Bim [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49"> 49 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50"> 50 </xref>@ ] .
MEK1 or MEK2 activation had no significant effect on the expression of the pro @-@ apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak in these cells ( data not shown ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Silencing of MEK2 expression markedly inhibits the proliferation of human colon cancer cells </sec-title>
The results presented above clearly demonstrate that constitutive activation of either MEK isoform , MEK1 or MEK2 , is sufficient to fully transform intestinal epithelial cells to the metastatic stage .
We next wanted to determine if human colon cancer cells depend on the activity of MEK isoforms for cell proliferation .
Several human colon carcinoma cell lines display constitutive phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAP kinases [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] , likely resulting from activation of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 .
The HCT116 cell line , which represents one of the best studied model of colorectal cancer cells , display constitutive activation of the two MEK isoforms ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
To assess the individual roles of MEK1 and MEK2 , we expressed short @-@ hairpin ( sh ) RNAs specifically targeting MEK1 or MEK2 gene in HCT116 cells using VSV @-@ pseudotyped lentiviral vectors .
We tested the effect of 5 distinct shRNAs for MEK1 and 3 shRNAs for MEK2 , using as control a GFP @-@ encoding vector .
We selected the two most efficient shRNAs to MEK1 and MEK2 genes ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> ) .
A non @-@ silencing inactive MEK1 shRNA was used as additional negative control in these experiments .
The efficiency of transduction estimated by GFP immunofluorescence was over 90 % , and therefore the experiments were performed without cellular selection .
As shown by immunoblot analysis , lentivirus @-@ mediated delivery of MEK1 shRNAs resulted in complete silencing of MEK1 expression with no effect on MEK2 , whereas the two MEK2 shRNAs markedly knocked @-@ down MEK2 expression without affecting MEK1 isoform ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6B </xref> ) .
We then analyzed the functional consequence of MEK1 or MEK2 silencing on the proliferation rate of the cells .
Strikingly , lowering of MEK2 expression with the two shRNAs completely suppressed the proliferation of HCT116 cells , whereas MEK1 shRNAs exerted a significant but much weaker effect ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6B </xref> ) .
The extent of inhibition observed with MEK2 shRNAs was similar to that obtained by treating cells with the non @-@ selective MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor U0126 .
We also showed that silencing of MEK1 or MEK2 expression significantly reduces the extent of ERK1 and ERK2 activating phosphorylation ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7 </xref> ) .
To verify whether this differential contribution of MEK isoforms could be generalized to other colorectal cancer cells , we examined the impact of MEK1 or MEK2 silencing on the proliferation of two other human colon cancer cell lines .
We specifically chose the human colon carcinoma cell lines SW480 ( which harbors a <i> KRAS </i> mutation like HCT116 ) and HT-29 ( harboring a <i> BRAF </i> mutation ) .
SW480 cells display a comparable expression pattern of MEK1 and MEK2 proteins as HCT116 cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
Similar to HCT116 cells , knock-down of MEK2 expression dramatically suppressed the proliferation of SW480 cells , whereas MEK1 silencing induced a significant but much lower decrease of cell proliferation ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6C </xref> ) .
Similar results were obtained in HT-29 cells , except that the inhibitory effect of MEK1 shRNAs on proliferation was quantitatively more important than on HCT116 and SW480 cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6D </xref> ) .
This observation could be explained by the much higher expression of MEK1 in the HT-29 cell line as compared to HCT116 or SW480 cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) , which may have a more important contribution to total MEK1 @/@ MEK2 signaling .
However , the single inactivation of MEK2 was still capable of abolishing the proliferation of HT-29 cells even in the presence of high MEK1 levels .
For all colorectal cancer cell lines tested , the inhibition of proliferation seen with MEK2 shRNAs was comparable to that achieved with the MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor U0126 .
To further extend our investigation to non @-@ colorectal carcinomas , we tested the effect of MEK1 and MEK2 shRNAs on the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA @-@ MB-231 , which exhibit strong constitutive activation of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 signaling ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
Interestingly , the MEK2 shRNA-06 completely inhibited the proliferation of MDA @-@ MB-231 cells to the same extent as the drug inhibitor U0126 ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4"> 4 </xref> ) .
The other MEK2 shRNA-08 also markedly but not completely inhibited cell proliferation , consistent with its lower silencing activity in these cells .
Expression of MEK1 shRNAs suppressed cell proliferation by approximately 50 % .

The mutational status of <i> KRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> in all 45 ovarian carcinomas is summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref>@ .
Somatic mutations of <i> KRAS </i> were identified in 8 ( 13.7 % ) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas .
In contrast , somatic mutations of <i> BRAF </i> were identified in 5 ( 8.6 % ) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas .
Somatic mutations of either <i> KRAS </i> or <i> BRAF </i> were identified in 12 ( 20.6 % ) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas .
Most <i> KRAS </i> mutations were located at codon 12 and all <i> BRAF </i> mutations at codon 600 .
Both of these codons are mutation hot spots .
Interestingly , simultaneous mutations of <i> KRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> did not occur in the tested ovarian carcinomas with the exception of one mucinous case .
A panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cultures was first analysed for tumour mutation status in the <i> KRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> genes .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1 </xref> , three ovarian cancer cell lines harboured either <i> KRAS </i> or <i> BRAF </i> mutations .
The frequency of either <i> KRAS </i> or <i> BRAF </i> mutations in conventional serous high @-@ grade carcinomas ( 4.0 % : 1 @/@ 25 ) was significantly lower than in the other histological type ( 32.2 % : 10 @/@ 31 ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Relationship between <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutations and p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 expression or clinicopathological factors </sec-title>
The immunoreactivity of active p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 was detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the tumour cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref> ) .
This is consistent with an earlier report ( <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14"> Mizumoto <i> et al </i> , 2007 </xref> ) .
Positive active p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 was identified in 27 ( 46.6 % ) out of 58 ovarian carcinomas .
The patients were stratified into two groups depending on the mutational status of <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i>@ .
The relationships between <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutations and clinicopathological factors , including p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 expression are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2 </xref>@ .
There was no significant correlation between <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutations and the patient 's age .
The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2 </xref> show that <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutation is correlated significantly with FIGO stage I , II ( <i> P </i> < 0.001 ) , and p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 ( <i> P </i> < 0.001 ) .
In addition , there were significant correlations between <i> KRAS @/@ BRA </i>@ F mutations and pathological grade ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.004 ) , and histological subtype ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.014 ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Effect of <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutations or p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 on the prognosis of ovarian carcinomas </sec-title>
Next , we examined the prognostic effect of <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutations and p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 expression .
Out of the 58 samples that we examined , 45 were available for prognostic analysis .
Kaplan @–@ Meier estimates of overall survival are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ .
There was no significant relationship between <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutations or p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 expression and overall survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.2460 , <i> P </i>@ = 0.9339 , respectively ) .
Univariate analysis showed that only FIGO stage III , IV affected the overall survival of patients with ovarian carcinoma significantly ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.014 ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Effects of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 inactivation on ovarian carcinoma <i> in vitro </i> </sec-title>
A panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cultures of ovarian cancer were first analysed for <i> KRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> gene mutation status .
Mutational status was correlated with growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 that prevented activation of the downstream target , ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
Western blot analysis showed a dose @-@ dependent effect on the expression of active ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in ES2 cells , and active ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was not detectable 6 h after treating the cells with CI-1040 at a concentration of 5 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref> ) .
As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref> , four of the tumours harbouring either <i> KRAS </i> or <i> BRAF </i> mutations showed a marked reduction ( < 50 % of DMSO control ) in the cell number in the CI-1040 @-@ treated group as compared with the other 14 tumours containing wild-type <i> KRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> ( <i> P </i> < 0.001 ) .
CI-1040 had no significant effect on the growth of normal cells , including the OSE cells .
It is likely that <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutation is not the only determinant for activating ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
Therefore , we analysed p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 expression in each of the cell lines listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref>@ .
Only four of these cell lines , MDAH2774 , ES2 , MPSC1 , and POC1 , strongly expressed p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 .
SKOV3 and A2780 showed weak expression of ERK1 @/@ ERK2.These results suggest that activation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 may depend on <i> KRAS @/@ BRAF </i> mutation in ovarian cancer cells .
To assess the mechanisms underlying growth inhibition by CI-1040 , we measured the percentages of BrdUrd @-@ labelled cells and Annexin V @-@ labelled cells to estimate proliferation and apoptosis , respectively .
We found that CI-1040 significantly reduced cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in cell lines with either <i> KRAS </i> or <i> BRAF </i> mutations in comparison with cell lines with wild-type sequences ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6 </xref> , <xref ref-type="other" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure 1 </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Effects of CI-1040 ERK1 @/@ ERK2 inactivation on ovarian carcinomas <i> in vivo </i> </sec-title>
On the basis of the above findings , we investigated whether CI-1040 had a growth @-@ inhibitory effect on tumour formation and development <i> in vivo </i>@ .
Tumour xenografts from both MDAH2774 ( <i> KRAS </i> mutant ) and SKOV3 ( wild type of <i> KRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> ) cell lines were established in a <i> nu </i>@ / @<i> nu </i> mouse model .

Identification of the B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk MAP kinase pathway as a target for all @-@ trans retinoic acid during skin cancer promotion ( PMID : 19432991 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
We have used the 2 @-@ stage dimethylbenzanthracene ( DMBA ) / 12 @- @<i> O </i>@ -@ tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) mouse skin carcinogenesis model to investigate the chemopreventive effects of ATRA .
We have compared the gene expression profiles of control skin to skin subjected to the 2 @-@ stage protocol , with or without ATRA , using Affymetrix 430 2.0 DNA microarrays .
Approximately 49 % of the genes showing altered expression with TPA treatment are conversely affected when ATRA is co-administered .
The activity of these genes , which we refer to as ' counter @-@ regulated ' , may contribute to chemoprevention by ATRA .
The counter @-@ regulated genes have been clustered into functional categories and bioinformatic analysis has identified the B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk branch of the MAP kinase pathway as one containing several genes whose upregulation by TPA is blocked by ATRA .
We also show that ATRA blocks signaling through this pathway , as revealed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting .
Finally , we found that blocking the B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk pathway with a pharmacological inhibitor , Sorafenib ( BAY43 @-@ 9006 ) , induces squamous differentiation of existing skin SCCs formed in the 2 @-@ stage model .

<sec-title level="2"> ATRA reverses many of the gene expression changes caused by TPA in mouse skin : microarray @-@ based analysis </sec-title>
Our group and others have shown that ATRA can suppress tumor promotion by TPA in the 2 @-@ stage model , but only as long as it is being co-administered with TPA [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"> 9 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
If ATRA treatment is discontinued while TPA treatment is maintained , the mice showed a linear increase in tumor multiplicity with time after stopping the last treatment [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
This suggests that ATRA may be primarily acting to suppress promotion by TPA , but has little apparent effect on initiation .
In order to explore the mechanism of the chemopreventive effect of ATRA at an early step during TPA @-@ induced tumor promotion , we performed Affymetrix DNA microarray analyses for mouse skin subjected to the 2 @-@ stage protocol for 3 weeks , with and without co-administration of ATRA .
We chose the 3 week time point because this precedes the appearance of tumors but is after the TPA treated skin exhibits pronounced hyperplasia ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> ) ; and this time point proved to be advantageous for identifying genes regulated by TPA plus retinoid combinations in mouse skin in a previous study from our laboratory [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
We reason that at least a portion of important TPA @-@ induced promotion events will have taken place by this time .
Of the ~ 45,000 probe sets ( representing ~ 39,000 transcripts and variants from over 34,000 characterized mouse genes ) on the 430 2.0 GeneChip , expression of 3,948 were altered by TPA , upwards or downwards , relative to untreated controls ( fold changes between treatment groups ≥ 1.5 , with p ≤ 0.05 ) .
This group of genes was divided into clusters as described in Materials and Methods .
The heatmap in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> represents the genes that fall into each subcluster , with expression patterns produced by normalized raw scores for the subcluster indicated in the panels on the right .
Amongst the 3,948 total TPA regulated genes , 49.5 % were found to be in the C1A and C2A subclusters .
We are calling these genes ' counter @-@ regulated ' because their direction of expression ( increase or decrease ) in TPA + ATRA treated skin compared to TPA treated skin is opposite to that of TPA treated skin compared to control skin .
This data can also be represented graphically as scatterplots ( Fig. S1 , additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> ) .
We note that when comparing control skin with TPA + ATRA skin , the majority of counter @-@ regulated genes lie close the x = y diagonal , indicating that ATRA can suppress TPA effects on expression of these genes completely or near completely ( Fig. S1C , additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> , see C1A and C2A subclusters ) .
A subset of the C1A and C2A genes are listed in Table S1 in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref> , sorted according to their known function in cellular signaling pathways , using the GeneSifter program .
The table lists genes in the major signaling pathways in epithelial cells that have the highest Z-scores .
Z-score is a measure of the significance of over @-@ representation for a particular gene list within an ontology group [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
We also identified several counter @-@ regulated genes that were previously determined to be TPA regulated ( Table S2 , additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> ) .
This abrogation of TPA effect on gene expression by ATRA is consistent with the findings of numerous investigators who have shown that TPA activates the AP-1 transcription factor complex , and that AP-1 activity is inhibited by ATRA through the retinoid receptors [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"> 10 </xref>@ ] for review and [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref>@ ] .
<sec-title level="2"> ATRA suppresses B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk signaling in early and late tumor progression times in the 2 @-@ stage skin carcinogenesis model </sec-title>
Examination of the above microarray results revealed altered expression of a disproportionate number of genes involved in the MAP kinase signaling pathway , in particular the B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk pathway ( Table S1 , additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref> ) .
We next performed a 2 @-@ stage skin carcinogenesis experiment as above , except that in this study the protocol was carried out for 30 weeks .
Tumor counts were recorded each week and mice were sacrificed at multiple time points ( 6 hours , 3 , 7 , 10 , and 30 weeks of treatment ) , for subsequent analysis of B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk pathway signaling .
The reduced tumor multiplicity and increased tumor latency for mice treated with TPA+ATRA , compared to mice treated with TPA alone , indicated the potent tumor suppressive activity of ATRA , in agreement with previous results ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , compare black line with blue line ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"> 9 </xref>@ ] .
However a small number of tumors were observed in the mice treated with TPA+ATRA .
Interestingly , histological examination of these ATRA resistant tumors revealed a less differentiated phenotype than for the tumors that arose in the mice treated with TPA alone ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
These tumors closely resembled advanced SCC , while the tumors in the TPA mice were papillary , with a high degree of keratinization as confirmed by a immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining for cytokeratin 10 ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> , lower panels ) .
In order to investigate the effects of ATRA on TPA @-@ induced activation of the B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk pathway , we performed IHC staining of paraffin sections from mouse skin treated with TPA , ATRA , TPA+ATRA , or acetone solvent , with phosphorylation site @-@ specific antibodies to B-Raf ( phospho @-@ Ser 445 ) , Mek1 @/@ Mek2 ( phospho @-@ Ser 217 @/@ 221 ) , and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 ( phospho @-@ Thr202 @/@ Tyr 204 ) .
The 6 h , 3 , 7 , 10 and 30 week time points were selected for sample isolation in order to obtain data prior to tumor formation ( 6 h and 3 weeks ) , just as tumors are beginning to be detectable ( 7 weeks ) , after the majority of mice have tumors ( 10 weeks ) , and after tumors had grown substantially ( 30 weeks ) .
In the TPA treated skin , hyperproliferation was correlated with increased levels of activated ( phosphorylated ) B-Raf , Mek1 @/@ Mek2 , and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 , as detected by increased red fluorescence from the Alexa 546 @-@ coupled secondary antibody .
Results are shown for a representative ( 3 week ) time point ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ; compare TPA panels to Control panels for all 3 rows ) .
Skin treated with a single application of TPA , ATRA or TPA+ATRA showed no notable changes in staining for any of the phosphoproteins ( data not shown ) .
pB-Raf was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm in TPA treated skin at all time points , and this effect was blocked with co-administration of ATRA with TPA ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , upper rows and data not shown ) .
We did not observe any changes in phosphorylation of c-Raf ( RAF1 ) , the other Raf family member present in skin , with any of the treatments using an antibody to phospho @-@ serine 338 ( Fig. S2 , additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4"> 4 </xref> ) .
pMek1 @/@ pMek2 levels were increased and expression was localized predominantly to the inner surface of the cell membrane in TPA treated skin ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , middle rows ) .
This observation is notable since it has been shown that the translocation of pMek to the cell membrane results in lowering the threshold for activation of MAP kinase signal output [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref>@ ] .
As was observed for pB-Raf , the increased levels of pMek1 @/@ pMek2 was blocked with co-administration of ATRA .
Staining for pErk1 @/@ pErk2 was observed in pairs of scattered nuclei in control skin , with an increase in staining intensity for TPA treated skin , as would be predicted accompanying hyperproliferation .
Fewer nuclei were stained for TPA+ATRA treated skin than for TPA treatment alone ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , bottom rows ) .
We attempted to quantitate pErk1 @/@ pErk2 levels by determining the percent positive nuclei in the treated skin .
At all time points except 30 weeks , the percent positive pErk staining nuclei actually decreased in TPA treated skin compared to controls and TPA+ATRA skin ( data not shown ) .
This was due to the far greater number of total cells in the hyperplastic TPA treated skin .
To more precisely measure the levels of phosphorylation of the MAP kinase signaling proteins in this model , we performed Western blot analysis on epidermal lysates pooled from 5 mice per treatment group for each time point , from skin adjacent to the tissue that was embedded for sectioning and IHC .
Using 10 weeks as a representative time point , co-administration of ATRA with TPA resulted in a lower level of pB-Raf , pMek1 @/@ pMek2 and pErk1 @/@ pErk2 , than with TPA treatment alone ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> compare TPA and TPA+ATRA lanes ) .
At the same time there is an increase in the protein levels of total Erk1 @/@ Erk2 with TPA treatment that is suppressed by ATRA .
The results from both IHC and Western blot analysis indicate that suppression of pB-Raf , pMek1 @/@ pMek2 , and pErk1 @/@ pErk2 levels by ATRA .
<sec-title level="2"> P38 and JNK branches of the MAP Kinase cascade are not suppressed by ATRA treatment </sec-title>
The two other major MAP kinase signaling pathways besides the B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk pathway are the Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and p38 MAP kinase pathways .
In order to confirm our previous microarray results , which suggested that these pathways were less important in regards to ATRA suppression of TPA induced tumor promotion , we performed IHC on tissue sections taken at the 7 week time point from the same 2 @-@ stage skin carcinogenesis experiment as above .
Using antibodies to phosphorylated ( activated ) p38 ( Thr180 @/@ Tyr182 ) , and JNK ( Thr183 @/@ Tyr185 ) we observed that , unlike the B-Raf , Mek1 @/@ Mek2 and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 proteins , neither p38 nor JNK were increased in phosphorylation upon TPA treatment ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> , compare TPA panels to Control ) .
Importantly , the phosphorylation levels of p38 and JNK were not suppressed by co-administration of ATRA with TPA ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> , compare TPA and TPA+ATRA panels ) .
This observation was confirmed by Western blotting using the same phospho @-@ specific antibodies , as well as antibodies to total p38 and total JNK ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> ) .
Interestingly we observed a modest increase in p38 phosphorylation in the skin treated with ATRA alone , suggesting that the p38 pathway could play a role in mediating retinoid effects in skin .
<sec-title level="2"> Sorafenib suppresses cell growth in TPA @-@ induced tumors </sec-title>
We hypothesize that ATRA exerts its tumor suppressive effect by blocking B-Raf @/@ Mek @/@ Erk signaling .
This predicts that blocking this pathway through another means should also suppress tumorigenesis and @/@ or the growth of tumors .
To test this prediction we have used a novel Raf inhibiting bi @-@ aryl urea compound from Bayer Pharmaceuticals called BAY 43 @-@ 9006 , or Sorafenib [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
This compound has been shown to inhibit MAP kinase signaling in colon , pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines , as well as inhibit tumor growth in colon , breast and non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer mouse xenograft models .
Tumor @-@ bearing SENCAR mice that had been treated topically with TPA , twice weekly for 27 weeks , were treated with Sorafenib either topically or by gavage , as described in the Materials and Methods .
Mice were photographed twice weekly to monitor tumor morphology and size .
Tumors that received only topical acetone solvent , along with the TPA treatment , displayed the exophytic papilloma morphology normally observed in TPA @-@ treated mice in this model ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
The histological appearance of these tumors was also typical of TPA @-@ induced papillomas ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6E </xref> ) .
Tumors receiving topical Sorafenib at either concentration displayed a dried and darkened appearance that was reminiscent of human keratoacanthoma ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> , compare A to B and data not shown ) .
Histological analysis of these tumors revealed that the bulk of the tumor mass was non @-@ cellular keratin , indicating a greatly enhanced level of squamous differentiation compared to the control TPA @-@ induced tumors ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> , compare E to F ) .
Interestingly , the tumors of mice treated with Sorafenib by oral gavage did not differ drastically in outward appearance from the control TPA @-@ induced tumors .
However upon histological examination these tumors appear very similar to the tumors that received topical Sorafenib ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6C </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6G </xref> ) .
It was previously shown in the breast and colon tumor xenograft models that inhibition of tumor growth was closely associated with suppression of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
We therefore stained paraffin @-@ embedded sections of the TPA @-@ induced tumors , with and without Sorafenib treatment , with the pErk1 @/@ pErk2 antibody .
The number of nuclei and intensity of staining was reduced for Sorafenib treated tumors compared to the TPA only @-@ treated tumors ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6H </xref> ) .
Episodic Src activation in uveal melanoma revealed by kinase activity profiling ( PMID : 19568237 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results : </sec-title>
We identified Src as a kinase that is associated with ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in UM .
However , low Src levels and reduced ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in metastatic cell lines suggest that proliferation in metastases can become independent of Src and RAS @/@ RAF @/@ MEK @/@ ERK signalling .
Inhibition of Src led to the growth reduction of primary UM cultures and cell lines , whereas metastatic cell line growth was only slightly reduced .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in UM </sec-title>
An antibody array was applied to investigate the MAPK pathway in 10 UM cell lines , in three primary UM and three UM metastasis .
We observed a uniform HSP27 phosphorylation , with the exception of in three UM cell lines ( OCM1 , -@ 3 , -@ 8 ) .
UMs displaying activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 as well as phosphorylated HSP27 were most common , whereas signals for phosphorylated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 were low in metastasis tissue ( MET1 @-@ 3 ) and metastatic UM cell lines ( OMM1 , OMM2.3 and OMM2.5 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1 </xref> ) .
Remarkably , two of the metastatic cell lines ( OMM2.3 , OMM2.5 ) are derived from the same patient as cell line Mel270 but contained far less activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
<sec-title level="2"> Differential kinase activity in UM </sec-title>
Reduction of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in metastatic cell lines compared with that in primary UM cell lines provides a model to identify the underlying mechanism of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in the absence of <i> BRAF </i> and <i> NRAS </i> mutations .
To investigate whether a kinase is differentially activated between primary UM cell lines and metastatic UM cell lines , we used peptide @-@ based tyrosine kinase arrays ( <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18"> Lemeer <i> et al </i> , 2007 </xref> ) .
The UM cell lines displayed a high kinase activity , whereas the metastatic UM cell lines displayed a low kinase activity , although the same amount of lysate was incubated ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2A </xref> ) .
After normalisation , we could analyse the kinase data and identify nine substrates that were significantly differentially phosphorylated between primary and metastatic UM cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2B </xref> , <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ) .
Primary UM and metastatic tissue also showed differential phosphorylation of these nine peptides , although not as clearly as observed in the cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2C </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Candidate kinase : Src </sec-title>
We identified nine peptides derived from eight proteins that were differentially phosphorylated between primary and metastatic cell line lysates .
On the basis of a literature search , we identified candidate tyrosine kinases for eight out of nine peptides ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ) ( <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5"> Cooper <i> et al </i> , 1983 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib35"> Thomas and Brugge , 1997 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16"> Koike <i> et al </i> , 2003 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8"> Diella <i> et al </i> , 2004 </xref> ) .
Among the candidates , Src and Src family members were most prominent .
To validate the candidacy of Src , we performed <i> in vitro </i> inhibition experiments with the Src-kinase @-@ specific inhibitors PP1 and the PP1 analogue , PP2 .
We added PP1 and PP2 ( 10 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> ) to lysates of primary UM tissue and of a primary UM cell line and measured the inhibitory effect of these Src inhibitors using kinase array ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
A total of seven out of nine substrates that identified Src in the first screen displayed a significantly reduced phosphorylation when PP1 or PP2 were added to lysates of UM1 and Mel270 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
The PLCG1 peptide and one of the PAX1 ( Y31 ) substrates did not reach significance but were still phosphorylated at a reduced level after PP1 and PP2 treatments .
The peptide representing FAK1 Y576 @/@ Y577 is a genuine substrate for Src , which was not detected in the UM cell line comparison , but phosphorylation was significantly downregulated by PP1 and PP2 treatments .
In the control experiment , in which we added the inactive analogue of PP1 ( PP3 ) to cell lysates , we did not observe a loss of kinase activity ( not shown ) .
The kinase activity of metastasis tissue and UM tissue differed marginally ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2C </xref> ) , and incubation with PP1 ( 10 <i> μ </i> <sc> M </sc> ) resulted in a decimation of kinase activity similar to the inhibition that we observed in UM tissue ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3B </xref> ) .
To validate Src activity , Mel270 was transfected with two siRNA constructs that target Src and reduced kinase activity ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3B </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Regulation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and growth </sec-title>
To investigate whether Src contributes to ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in Mel270 , we analysed the two Src siRNA @-@ transfected cell cultures with the MAPK antibody array .
At 24 and 48 h after transfection with Src siRNA , we observed a reduced ERK1 phosphorylation , whereas ERK2 phosphorylation was minimally affected ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref> ) .
Whether Src inhibition and consequently a lowered ERK activation in UM cell lines is associated with a reduced growth was investigated with the WST-1 viability assay ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref> ) .
All UM cell lines showed a PP1 @-@ dose and time ( 1 @–@ 6 days ) - dependent reduction in cell viability but the magnitude of the response differed widely .
In general , the metastatic UM cell lines were less affected by PP1 .
We also determined the growth inhibition rate of PP1 in cultures of five primary UM cell cultures and observed an increased sensitivity to PP1 treatment compared with the cell lines .
We had to take samples at day 3 of PP1 treatment because , thereafter , massive cell death occurred ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5B </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Src protein is reduced in metastasis cell line </sec-title>
Src is regulated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues at position 416 ( Y416 ) and 527 ( Y527 ) .
The expression of phosphorylated Src Y416 , which is associated with an active conformation , was low in the metastatic UM cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6A </xref> ) .
Surprisingly , the phosphorylation of Y527 , which is associated with an inactive conformation , was also low , and a subsequent analysis indicated that Src expression is low in metastatic UM cell lines .
Therefore , the difference between kinase activity in metastatic cell lines ( OMM1 , OMM2.3 and OMM2.5 ) and UM cell lines ( OCM1 , OCM3 , OCM8 , Mel202 , Mel270 , Mel285 , Mel290 and 92.1 ) seems to be the result of a difference in Src expression .
To investigate the origin of a lowered Src expression , we performed a gene expression analysis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6B </xref> ) .
Src gene expression varied widely in the cell lines and in the metastatic cell lines , but a correlation between protein and gene expression was not observed in UM cell lines .
A western analysis of Src expression in UM and metastasis tissue revealed a very high Src expression in only one out of three primary UM , whereas all three metastasis tissues displayed medium expression of Src protein ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6C </xref> ) .
Combination of cetuximab with chemoradiation , trastuzumab or MAPK inhibitors : mechanisms of sensitisation of cervical cancer cells ( PMID : 19654571 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results : </sec-title>
Cetuximab with cisplatin and radiation achieved maximum cytotoxic effects for A431 , Caski and C33A cells ( high , intermediate and low EGFR expression , respectively ) in CA .
Cetuximab efficiently decreased MAPK and AKT phosphorylation in A431 cells but slightly less in Caski and C33A cells .
To check whether further EGFR , HER2 or MAPK inhibition would improve cetuximab 's cytotoxicity , we combined it with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , trastuzumab or a MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor ( PD98059 ) .
In Caski , but not in C33A cells , cetuximab cooperated with the TKI , reducing cell survival and AKT and MAPK phosphorylation .
However , cetuximab with trastuzumab or PD98059 reduced survival and MAPK phosphorylation of both cell lines .

<sec-title level="2"> Differential effects of RxT , cisplatin and cetuximab on cell proliferation and cell @-@ cycle kinetics </sec-title>
We examined the antiproliferative effects of isolated RxT , cisplatin and cetuximab treatments on A431 , Caski and C33A cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1A–F </xref> ) , which express high to low EGFR levels , respectively ( see Figures 3A and 5A ) .
A431 growth is impaired by EGFR inhibitors ( <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9"> Janmaat <i> et al </i> , 2003 </xref> ) , so we used this cell line for comparison with the CC cell lines .
A431 and Caski cells showed similar resistance to RxT and low cisplatin concentrations ( IC @<sub> 30 </sub> ) in CA and MTT assays ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1A and B </xref> ) , but Caski cells showed increased resistance at higher cisplatin concentrations ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> and IC @<sub> 80 </sub> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1B </xref> ) .
C33A cells were , in turn , quite sensitive to both treatments ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1A and B </xref> ) .
Cetuximab treatment decreased the viability of all cell lines in CA and MTT experiments at all concentrations tested ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1C and D </xref> ) .
These effects were related to an increase of 14.1 , 12.6 and 6.5 % in cell number at G @<sub> 0 </sub>@ /G @<sub> 1 </sub> for A431 , Caski and C33A cells on cetuximab treatment , respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1E </xref> ) and a decrease in the population of cells at S and G @<sub> 2 </sub>@ /M phases when compared to controls ( CT ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1E </xref> ) .
Apoptotic cells are usually found in the sub @-@ G @<sub> 1 </sub> phases and , accordingly , 24-h cetuximab treatment increased this cell population by 4.6 , 3.9 and 2.9 % in A431 , Caski and C33A cells , respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1E </xref> ) .
Additionally , apoptotic cells were also observed by Hoechst staining in all cell lines after cetuximab treatment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1F </xref> ) and , even in C33A cells , which express low EGFR levels , a reduction of 21 % in cell proliferation was obtained , especially at high MAb concentration ( 100 <i> μ </i>@ g ml @<sup> −1 </sup> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1D </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Cetuximab induces chemo @/@ radiosensitisation of CC cells </sec-title>
We evaluated whether the combination of cetuximab ( 100 <i> μ </i>@ g ml @<sup> −1 </sup> ) with RxT and @/@ or cisplatin could enhance the cytotoxic effects observed in CA .
Isolated cetuximab , cisplatin and RxT treatments decreased the survival of all cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figures 2A–D </xref> ) but the combination of cetuximab with either RxT or cisplatin enhanced these effects ( <i> P </i> < 0.05 ) .
Furthermore , the triple combination of cetuximab , cisplatin and RxT achieved maximum effects for all cell lines in CA ( demonstrative pictures of A431 cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2D </xref> ) .
Caski cells are HPV @-@ positive and express intermediate levels of EGFR and HER2 , resembling typical CC tumours .
In this cell line , the triple combination reached up to 70 % inhibition in CA ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2B </xref> ) whereas in C33A cells , an inhibition of 60 % was observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2C </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> The CC cell lines express different basal levels of total and phosphorylated EGFR , HER-2 , AKT and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 </sec-title>
A431 cells strongly express EGFR ( <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9"> Janmaat <i> et al </i> , 2003 </xref> ) whereas Caski and C33A cells show moderate and low expression levels , respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
Additionally , we confirmed EGFR expression by real-time RT-PCR and by FACS analysis .
The relative <i> EGFR </i> mRNA level of A431 is high and Caski cells express two times more <i> EGFR </i> than C33A ( Figure 5A ) .
Moreover , FACS analysis showed that both a murine anti @-@ EGFR MAb and cetuximab could detect high EGFR expression on the surface of A431 cells and intermediate and low levels in Caski and C33A cells , respectively ( Figure 5B ) .
HER2 expression was more homogenous among the cell lines with Caski and C33A cells expressing 20 and 40 % more HER2 than A431 cells , respectively .
The basal phosphorylation status of EGFR and HER2 was inversely correlated , with higher levels of p-EGFR in A431 cells and higher levels of p-HER2 in C33A and Caski cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
On EGF binding , the major signalling pathways activated are the MAPK and AKT cascades ( <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5"> Citri and Yarden , 2006 </xref> ) .
A431 and Caski cells show low basal levels of p-AKT whereas C33A cells have a much higher level .
A431 and C33A cells had higher levels of activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( p-p44 @/@ p-p42 MAPK ) but no significant differences in total MAPK were observed among the cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Cetuximab inhibits EGFR and HER2 phosphorylation </sec-title>
To investigate the molecular determinants for cetuximab 's effects in MTT and CA , we analysed EGFR phosphorylation by WB in cells treated with cetuximab ( 100 <i> μ </i>@ g ml @<sup> −1 </sup> ) alone or in the presence of EGF .
Receptor phosphorylation was increased by EGF in A431 and Caski cells , whereas cetuximab reduced it ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3B and C </xref> ) .
Epidermal growth factor and cetuximab also induced a slight decrease in the total amount of EGFR in these cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3B and C </xref> ) .
Epidermal growth factor receptor can interact with another member of the ErbB family , HER2 , to form heterodimers that are very potent in activating signal transduction pathways ( <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5"> Citri and Yarden , 2006 </xref> ) .
On cetuximab treatment there were no changes in total HER2 in the CC cell lines , whereas EGF @-@ induced HER2 phosphorylation was inhibited in A431 and Caski cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3B and C </xref> ) .
Interestingly , in C33A cells , which express more HER2 than EGFR ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Fig 3A </xref> ) , cetuximab markedly reduced EGF @-@ induced HER2 phosphorylation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3D </xref> ) .
There were no changes in total AKT and MAPK proteins in all cell lines on cetuximab treatment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3B–D </xref> ) .
Epidermal growth factor increased AKT and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in A431 and Caski cells but in C33A cells there was only a slight increase .
This was not unexpected , because both pathways are activated in this cell line ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
Cetuximab inhibited EGF @-@ induced AKT phosphorylation more strongly in A431 cells and less so in Caski and C33A cells .
Indeed , it markedly reduced EGF @-@ induced ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in A431 cells , but in Caski and C33A cells the reduction was more modest ( 60 and 20 % inhibition , respectively ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3B–D </xref> ) , suggesting that persistent signalling through these pathways led to increased survival of Caski and C33A cells , when compared to A431 cells in the presence of cetuximab .
<sec-title level="2"> Cetuximab combined with trastuzumab synergistically reduces cell proliferation and activation of downstream signalling pathways in CC cells </sec-title>
We speculated that cells expressing higher EGFR @/@ HER2 ratios , such as A431 cells , rely more on EGFR signalling for MAPK pathway activation and cell proliferation , whereas cells with a lower EGFR @/@ HER2 ratio , such as C33A cells , depend more on EGFR @/@ HER2 heterodimer signalling .
Based on this assumption , the inhibition of the EGFR @/@ HER2 heterodimer by anti @-@ EGFR ( cetuximab ) and anti @-@ HER2 ( trastuzumab ) MAbs should interfere with C33A cell proliferation .
As expected , this combination markedly reduced C33A cell colony formation leading to a synergistic interaction ( <i> R </i>@ = 0.58 ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figures 4A and B </xref> ) , with concomitant reduction of MAPK and AKT phosphorylation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4D </xref> ) .
Indeed , an additive effect ( <i> R </i>@ = 0.84 ) was also noted for Caski cells , that express intermediate levels of EGFR and HER2 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) , with a decrease of almost 60 % in cell survival ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figures 4A and B </xref> ) and inhibition of downstream signalling pathways ( MAPK and AKT ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4C </xref> ) .
There were no changes in total AKT and MAPK proteins in Caski and C33A cell lines on treatments ( data not shown ) .
<sec-title level="2"> The combination of cetuximab with a TKI inhibits cell proliferation and MAPK phosphorylation in Caski but not in C33A cells </sec-title>
Based on the idea of an EGFR @/@ HER2 heterodimer signalling dependency of C33A cells , we investigated whether further EGFR inhibition with another targeted drug , such as TKIs , affected more Caski than C33A cells .
Therefore , we tested the combination of cetuximab with a specific EGFR TKI ( PD153035 ) .
As expected , combined treatments reduced Caski cell survival leading to an additive interaction ( <i> R </i>@ = 0.94 ) when compared to treatments alone ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4E </xref> ) .
Additionally , the double treatment in Caski cells was accompanied by a greater reduction of EGFR , HER2 , AKT and MAPK phosphorylation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4G </xref> ) .
Isolated cetuximab or PD153035 treatments reduced the survival of C33A cells in CA by the same proportion , reaching a more modest inhibition of HER2 , AKT and MAPK phosphorylation than in Caski cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figures 4E and G </xref> ) .
In contrast , the combined treatment proved to be antagonistic ( <i> R </i>@ = 1.28 ) , with no decrease in phosphorylated proteins when compared to either drug alone ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figures 4E and G </xref> ) .
Altogether , these data corroborate with our hypothesis that C33A cells are not so dependent on EGFR signalling for proliferation , as double EGFR inhibition with different drugs did not enhance the toxicity achieved by either agent alone .
Additionally , the targeting of EGFR and HER2 with two different MAbs showed synergistic inhibitory effects ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figures 4A and B </xref> ) demonstrating that heterodimer signalling is necessary for C33A cell proliferation .
Furthermore , these data indicate that the successful inhibition of the MAPK and @/@ or AKT pathways is a determinant factor for cetuximab efficacy in all CC cell lines .
<sec-title level="2"> Cetuximab combined with PD98059 synergistically reduces cell proliferation and MAPK pathway activation in CC cells </sec-title>
To confirm that the MAPK pathway is relevant for cetuximab response , drug combination experiments with PD98059 ( MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor ) were performed .
Both treatments inhibited Caski and C33A cell proliferation by the same magnitude , with a reduction of 50 % and an additive effect for the combination over single @-@ drug treatment in both cell lines ( <i> R </i>@ = 0.88 and <i> R </i>@ = 0.92 , respectively ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4F </xref> ) .
As expected , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4H </xref> shows that a strong inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation was seen in both cell lines on treatment with PD98059 alone or in combination with cetuximab .
As the combination of both treatments led to a near complete MAPK cascade blockage , accompanied by a significant reduction of CC cell proliferation , we confirmed that the inhibition of this pathway plays an important role in cetuximab 's efficacy .
<sec-title level="2"> Cetuximab induces ADCC in A431 and Caski , but not in C33A cells </sec-title>

Accordingly , at E/T ratios of 20 : 1 , cetuximab mediated ADCC in 26.4 and 15.1 % of A431 and Caski cells , respectively , but not in C33A cells ( 1.75 % ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5C </xref> ) .

The combination of cetuximab with RxT for 24 h had an additive effect and , after 48 h of treatment , a further reduction was observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figures 5D–F </xref> ) , suggesting that these treatments have the potential of interfering with angiogenesis even in cells that do not express high EGFR levels .
Expression and function of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha in human melanoma under non @-@ hypoxic conditions ( PMID : 19919690 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
HIF-1α mRNA and protein was increased in RGP vs melanocytes , VGP vs RGP and MET vs VGP melanoma cell lines .
We also detected expression of a HIF-1α mRNA splice variant that lacks part of the oxygen @-@ dependent regulation domain in WM1366 and WM9 melanoma cells .
Over-expression of HIF-1α and its splice variant in the RGP cell line SbCl2 resulted in a small increase in soft agar colony formation and a large increase in matrigel invasion relative to control transfected cells .
Knockdown of HIF-1α expression by siRNA in the MET WM9 melanoma cell line resulted in a large decrease in both soft agar colony formation and matrigel invasion relative to cells treated with non @-@ specific siRNA .
There is a high level of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in WM9 cells , indicating an activated Ras @-@ Raf @-@ MEK @-@ ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAPK pathway .
Treatment of WM9 cells with 30 μM U0126 MEK inhibitor , decreased ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation and resulted in a decrease in HIF-1α expression .
However , a 24 h treatment with 10 μM U0126 totally eliminated Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation , but did not change HIF-1 alpha levels .
Furthermore , siRNA knockdown of MEK siRNA did not change HIF-1 alpha levels .

<sec-title level="2"> Expression of HIF-1α in human melanoma cells </sec-title>
In addition to the well known pathway of HIF-1 alpha protein stabilization under hpoxic conditions , it has been established that many oncoproteins and growth factor signaling pathways up-regulate HIF-1α expression under normoxic conditions [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"> 18 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"> 19 </xref>@ ] .
However , there are few investigations into the normoxic expression of HIF-1α in human melanoma and its role in the malignant progression of this disease .
Here , we show that in human melanoma cells , the oxygen @-@ labile HIF-1α protein as well as its mRNA is expressed endogenously under normoxic conditions .
Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> shows that HIF-1α protein is highly expressed in WM9 cells relative to normal human melanocyte ( HEMn @-@ LP ) , but radial growth phase ( SbCl2 ) , and vertical growth phase ( WM1366 ) also express a higher amount of HIF-1α protein relative to human melanocytes .
Similar results are seen in second set of RGP , VGP and MET melanoma cell lines ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> ) .
HIF-1α was detected as 120 kD protein in nuclear extracts while no protein was detected in cytoplasmic extracts ( data not shown ) .
Hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α occurs at the protein level [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"> 3 </xref>@ ] .
Since HIF-1α protein was increased in human melanoma cells under normoxic conditions , we determined whether this increase might be due to increased HIF-1α mRNA levels .
Initially we used semi @-@ quantitative RT-PCR to assess expression of HIF-1α full length ( FL ) and a splice variant HIF-1α785 that is missing the acetylation site lys @<sup> 532 </sup> due to lack of exon 11 ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
This splice variant encodes HIF-1α protein that has been reported to be stable under normoxic conditions [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"> 17 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
Primers were designed so that full length HIF-1α would exclude HIF-1α785 by targeting exon 11 , which is absent in HIF-1α785 .
Primers for HIF-1α785 excluded HIF-1α by targeting the exon 10 @:@ 12 boundary only present in HIF-1α785 .
Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> shows that human melanoma cell lines express both full @-@ length and the 785 splice variant HIF-1α mRNA at a level that appeared to be higher than normal human melanocytes .
These findings were verified by qRT @-@ PCR measurement of full @-@ length and HIF-1α785 mRNA levels ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) .
All melanoma cell lines had increased expression of HIF-1α mRNA relative to normal human melanocytes .
In addition VGP and MET cell lines expressed more of the 785 HIF-1α mRNA than full length HIF-1α mRNA .
Overall the WM9 metastatic melanoma expressed the highest amount of 785 HIF-1α mRNA ( ~ 79× higher than normal human melanocytes ) .
<sec-title level="2"> HIFαFL and HIF-1α785 gain @-@ of @-@ function in radial growth phase SbCl2 cells </sec-title>
The level of HIF-1α protein is low in the radial growth phase SbCl2 cells relative to VGP or MET cell lines .
We determined the effect of HIF @-@ 1αFL or HIF-1α785 overexpression on SbCl2 anchorage @-@ independent growth and Matrigel invasion .
HIF @-@ 1αFL and HIF-1α785 were cloned into the pLenti @-@ V5-D-TOPO vector and transiently overexpressed in SbCl2 cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) .
HIF-1α785 overexpression resulted in a small , but statistically significant increase in anchorage @-@ independent growth , relative to mock or lacz transfected cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4D </xref> ) .
In contrast overexpression of both HIF @-@ 1αFL and HIF-α785 in SbCl2 resulted in a large and significant 3 @-@ fold increase in Matrigel invasion relative to mock or Lacz transfected cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> HIF-1α loss @-@ of @-@ function in human metastatic melanoma WM9 cells </sec-title>
HIF-1α protein is highly expressed under normoxic conditions in the WM9 human metastatic melanoma cell line .
To determine whether HIF-1α could be contributing to the malignant characteristics of these cells , we knocked down its expression and examine how this affected anchorage independent growth and Matrigel invasion .
WM9 cells were treated with 100 nM siRNA targeting HIF-1α ( Dharmacon ) which consistently decreased its expression by ~ 75 @-@ 85 % ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> ) .
Colony formation after 5 days in soft agarose was inhibited by 70 % in HIF-1α-siRNA transfected WM9 cells in comparison to cells transfected with control siRNA ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> ) .
A photo ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5C </xref> ) of the colonies formed at this time point in control vs. HIF-1α transfected cells verifies this decrease in soft agar colony formation .
Matrigel invasion was also significantly decreased in HIF-1α-siRNA transfected WM9 cells compared to control siRNA transfected WM9 cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5D </xref> ) .
Measurement of cell viability in the Matrigel chambers shows no difference between control vs. HIF-1α siRNA transfected cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5E </xref> ) .
These knock down studies suggest that increased non @-@ hypoxic expression of HIF-1α plays an important role in key malignant properties exhibited by these human melanoma cells .
<sec-title level="2"> Regulation of HIF-1α expression in human melanoma by the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAPK pathway </sec-title>
Hypoxia independent expression of HIF-1α is thought to be regulated by growth signaling pathways [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"> 18 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"> 19 </xref>@ ] and the majority of melanomas have constitutively active ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAPK pathway due to BRAF or N-Ras mutations [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , we determined whether HIF-1α expression in human metastatic melanoma WM9 cells was dependent on activation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAPK signaling .
These cells have an active ERK1 @/@ ERK2 MAPK pathway as evidenced by the high phosphorylation of ERK ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
Treatment of WM9 cells with 30 μM U0126 , a selective U0126 MEK inhibitor , decreased ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation and led to a time @-@ dependent decrease in HIF-1α protein expression ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) .
Although 30 μM U0126 has been used in published studies to selectively inhibit MEK [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] , the original paper describing this inhibitor [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref>@ ] used much lower concentrations to achieve high selectivity .
Therefore we repeated this experiment using 10 μM U0126 ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6B </xref> ) .
At 24 h of treatment , 10 μM U0126 completely suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , yet there was minimal change in the level of HIF-1α relative to control cells .
With further time of inhibitor treatment , phosphorylation of ERK was not totally suppressed , but HIF-1α levels decreased .
We also used siRNA specifically targeting MEK1 and 2 in WM9 cells to inhibit ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation .
Treatment of WM9 cells with siRNA targeting MEK1 and 2 consistently decreased its expression by greater than 90 % and also decreased ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation .
However , knockdown of MEK1 and 2 did not decrease the normoxic expression of HIF-1α protein in human metastatic melanoma WM9 cells ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6C </xref> ) .

Aurora-A activates Ral A and the phosphorylation of AKT as well as enhances the phosphorylation of MEK , ERK of WT cells .

<sec-title level="2"> Detection of Aurora-A overexpression accompanied with Ha @- @<i> ras </i> mutation in bladder cancers </sec-title>
Aurora-A overexpression accompanied with Ha @- @<i> ras </i> codon 12 mutation has been reported in bladder cancers [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"> 41 </xref>@ ] .
In this study , Ha @- @<i> ras </i> <sup> V12 </sup> mutation was detected in the tumour part of the bladder cancer specimen by SNP @-@ real @-@ time PCR and verified by sequence analysis ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> , Gly12 -> Val 12 ) .
The Aurora-A protein overexpression was detected in the same cancer part of the bladder tissue compared to the normal part by IHC staining ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> , T vs. N ) .
Similarly , Ki @- @<i> ras </i> codon 12 mutation and higher expression level of Aurora-A were only detected in the cancer part of the colon tissue ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> ) .
Taken together , despite of the difference in transformation of NIH3T3 cells by Ki @- @<i> ras </i> and Ha @- @<i> ras </i> , overexpression of Aurora-A and Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> ( Ki @- or Ha- ) mutations are simultaneously detected in various cancers including bladder and colon .
<sec-title level="2"> Establishment of stable cell lines over-expressing Aurora-A and mutant Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> </sec-title>
It is intriguing to unravel the combined effects of Aurora-A and mutant Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> on the morphological change and tumorigenesis of the cells .
Stable cell lines were established by transfecting Vector DNA , wild-type Aurora-A or kinase @-@ inactivated Aurora-A into 7 @-@ 4 cells , which was derived from NIH @/@ 3T3 cells harboring the inducible Ha @- @<i> ras </i> <sup> V12 </sup> oncogene [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref>@ ] , designated Vector , WT and KD cell line , respectively .
The expression levels of Ha @- @<i> ras </i> <sup> V12 </sup> in Vector , WT and KD cells in the presence of IPTG were much higher compared to the cells without IPTG ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
Aurora-A can physically interact with the tail of Histone H3 ( H3 ) and efficiently phosphorylates H3 at serine10 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"> 45 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48"> 48 </xref>@ ] .
In addition , activation of ERK pathway in Ha @- @<i> ras </i> transformed mouse fibroblasts increases the level of p-H3S10 .
Consistently , our data showed the level of phosphorylated H3S10 ( p-H3S10 detected by anti-p-H3S10 antibody ) in WT cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , lane 2 , 1.8 fold ) was higher than in Vector cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , lane 1 , 1.0 fold ) and KD cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , lane 3 , 0.9 fold ) in the absent of IPTG where Ras was not overexpressed .
Our data showed that the Aurora-A overexpressed in WT cells is functional .
In the presence of IPTG , where Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> protein was overexpressed , the level of phosphorylated H3S10 was increased both in Vector ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , lane 4 , 2.8 fold ) , WT ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , lane 5 , 3.8 fold ) and KD ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , lane 6 , 2.8 fold ) cells .
Biological activity analysis showed that WT cells over-expressing wild-type Aurora-A became rounded and formed aggregates in the presence of IPTG compared to the Vector cells and KD cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> ) .
Transforming analysis showed that WT cells form more foci compared to Vector and KD cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> ) .
Despite the fact that focus numbers were also increased in the other two cell lines , a further increase of focus number in WT cells was observed after IPTG induction ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> ) .
Taken together , both Aurora-A and mutant Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> overexpression can induce focus formation .
Further induction of focus formation was detected when these two genes were overexpressed simultaneously .
Cell proliferation analysis showed that WT cells grew slower than Vector and KD cells in the absence of IPTG .
Growth rate of Vector , WT and KD cells were decreased when mutant Ras was overexpressed ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2D </xref> ) .
The increase of cell aggregation of WT cells in the presence of IPTG was independent of cell growth rate .
<sec-title level="2"> Aurora-A overexpression increases phosphorylation status of MEK @/@ ERK and AKT as well as the activity of RalA in the Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> transformants </sec-title>
To clarify the effects of Aurora-A on the signaling pathways related to Ras overexpression , three downstream signaling pathways of Ras , Raf @/@ MEK , PI3K @/@ AKT and RalGDS @/@ Ral A were investigated .
The phosphorylation of MEK ( p-MEK ) was higher in WT cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 2 , 1.7 fold ) than that in Vector ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 1 , 1.0 fold ) and KD cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 3 , 0.8 fold ) .
P-MEK levels in each cell line were further increased after IPTG induction ( Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> is over-expressed ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .
The same phenomenon was also been observed in p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
These results indicated that Aurora-A may further increase Ras induced MEK @/@ ERK phosphorylation .
The effect of Aurora-A on the PI3K @/@ AKT pathway was evaluated by detecting phosphorylation of AKT ( p-AKT ) .
The p-AKT level was also higher in WT cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 2 , 2.1 fold ) compared to Vector and KD cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 1 , 1.0 fold and lane 3 , 1.1 fold , respectively ) .
Upon IPTG induction , Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> overexpression increased the level of p-AKT in Vector and KD cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 4 , 1.8 fold and lane 6 , 2.1 fold , respectively ) .
Co-expression of Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> and wild-type Aurora-A in WT cells increases the level of p-AKT ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 5 , 3.5 fold ) as compared to Ras @<sup> V12 </sup>@ overexpression alone ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 4 , 1.8 fold ) .
The RalGDS @/@ RalA signaling pathway was determined by detecting the activity of RalA using GST @-@ RalBD pull-down assay .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , Aurora-A overexpression alone activated RalA ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 2 , 2.0 fold ) as compared to the parental Vector cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 1 , 1.0 fold ) .
After IPTG induction , The RalA activity was increased by Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> overexpression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 4 , 2.5 fold ) .
Co-expression of Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> and wild-type Aurora-A in WT cells increase the activity of RalA of Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 5 , 3.7 fold ) .
Taken together , both Aurora-A and Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> increased the levels of p-MEK , pERK1 @/@ pERK2 , and p-AKT and the activation of RalA .
This induction was further enhanced when Aurora-A and Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> were overexpressed simultaneously .
To further confirm our results , Aurora-A specific small interference RNA ( siRNA ) was used .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> , Aurora-A specific siRNA decreased the expression level of Aurora-A in WT cells .
Accordingly , levels of p-MEK @/@ p-ERK , p-AKT and activation of RalA were also decreased when Aurora-A siRNA was introduced into WT cells upon IPTG induction .
Our results confirmed that wild-type @-@ Aurora-A enhance Ras downstream signaling pathways including MEK @/@ ERK , AKT and RalA .
<sec-title level="2"> The MEK @/@ ERK pathway is involved in WT cell aggregation </sec-title>
The involvement of MEK @/@ ERK , PI3K @/@ AKT and RalGDS @/@ RalA signaling pathways in Aurora-A @-@ related cell aggregation ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> , WT + IPTG ) was clarified by treatment of the cells with the following inhibitors : FTI-277 , a farnesylation inhibitor of Ras ; PD-98059 , the inhibitor of MEK kinase and LY-294002 , the inhibitor of PI3K kinase and RalASa94A , a mutant of Ral .
FTI-277 restrains Ras protein as a non @-@ farnesylated form and inhibits p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 expression dose @-@ dependently but had no effect on p-AKT ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
PD-98059 decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 ) but had no effect on other signaling pathways ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
LY-294002 reduced the phosphorylation of AKT ( p-AKT ) but had no effect on another signaling pathway ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , lanes 6 and 7 ) .
In summary , in WT cells Aurora-A increases the expression of p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 in a Ras dependent manner .
However , FTI-277 does not reduce the p-AKT in WT cells co-expressing Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> and wild-type Aurora-A . Wild-type Aurora-A activates RalA ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) and phosphorylates RalA at serine194 to promote cellular transformation and migration [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"> 38 </xref>@ ] .
To reveal the role of RalA phosphorylation at ser194 in Aurora-A induced RalA activation in WT cells , the mutants RalAS183A or RalAS194A were transiently transfected into WT cells and the RalA activity was evaluated .
Consistent with a previous report [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"> 38 </xref>@ ] , only RalAS194A could reduce the Ral A activity ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> , lane 3 ) .
To determine which signaling pathway is involved in the aggregation of WT cells during Ras @<sup> V12 </sup> overexpression , we first demonstrated that Aurora-A induced cell aggregation was blocked by Aurora-A specific small interfering RNA ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> ) .
The WT cells were treated with FTI-277 , PD-98059 or LY-294002 for 24 h and cell aggregation was observed .
Both FTI-277 and PD98059 reversed the aggregation of WT cells , whereas LY-294002 showed no effect on cell aggregation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> ) .
Because mutant RalAS194A was unable to block cell aggregation , its role in Aurora-A induced cell aggregation was excluded ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> ) .
Taken together , the Ras @/@ MEK @/@ ERK signaling pathway but not the PI3K @/@ AKT or RalGDS @/@ RalA pathway is responsible for Aurora-A induced cell aggregation .

We additionally identified a new <i> K-Ras </i> gene amplification event , present in approximately 2 % of tumours .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Identification of new <i> K-Ras </i> mutations </sec-title>
We have previously described <i> K-Ras </i> mutations at codons 12 , 13 and 61 in a series of 106 unselected colorectal tumours ( <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib33"> Smith <i> et al </i> , 2002 </xref> ) .
Our <i> K-Ras </i> mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing of <i> K-Ras </i> exon 1 ( codons 12 and 13 ) and exon 2 ( codon 61 ) , and would therefore have detected any additional mutations in these exons .
Codon 12 mutations were detected in 23 tumours ( 21.7 % ) and codon 13 mutations in 6 tumours ( 5.7 % ) , whereas no codon 61 mutations were detected .
Mutations at codon 19 ( G @<sub> 57 </sub>@ T , Leu @<sub> 19 </sub>@ Phe ) and in <i> B-Raf </i> ( V600E ) were found in single tumours ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2 </xref> ) .
To identify additional <i> K-Ras </i> mutations , and to establish the relative frequencies of individual <i> K-Ras </i> mutations in human colorectal tumours , we used WAVE analysis followed by direct sequencing to screen the same tumour series for mutations in <i> K-Ras </i> exon 3 and exon 4B , the most common exon 4 splice variant .
Four additional sequence changes were identified – an A to C change ( Lys to Asn substitution ) at codon 117 , a G to A change ( Ala to Thr substitution ) at codon 146 , a G to A change ( Arg to Gln substitution ) at codon 164 and a ‘ silent ' C to T nucleotide substitution , which did not alter the aspartic acid residue at codon 173 ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2 </xref> ) .
Together , these <i> K-Ras </i> mutations and the <i> B-Raf </i> V600E mutation increase overall Ras pathway mutation frequency from 27.4 to 37.8 % .
The predicted localisation of each mutation in the functional domains of the <i> K-Ras </i> protein is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ .
To determine whether our reported sequence changes represented tumour @-@ specific mutations or single @-@ nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , genomic DNA from blood and tumour tissue was compared .
Sequence changes at codons 19 , 117 , 146 and 164 were only detected in tumour DNA , whereas the codon 173 sequence change was detected in both blood and tumour DNA , and therefore represented a SNP ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2 </xref> ) .
To determine the frequencies of the codon 117 , 146 and 164 <i> K-Ras </i> mutations and the codon 173 SNP , PCR @–@ RFLP assays were designed to permit rapid screening of blood and tumour DNA ( <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1"> Appendix A </xref> ) .
Like the codon 19 mutation , the codon 117 and codon 164 mutations were found in single tumours , whereas the codon 146 mutation was found in 7 out of 106 ( 6.5 % ) of tumours .
No tumours with codon 19 , 117 , 146 or 146 mutations had additional <i> K-Ras </i> mutations in codons 12 , 13 or 61 .
The codon 173 SNP was found in 39 individuals , predicting an allele frequency of 18.2 % .
As this SNP did not lead to an amino acid substitution in the <i> K-Ras </i> protein , it was not analysed further .
<sec-title level="2"> Comparison of phenotypes associated with hotspot and new <i> K-Ras </i> mutations </sec-title>

Phenotypes associated with the various <i> K-Ras </i> mutations have previously not been systematically evaluated .
To compare the transformation potential of the <i> K-Ras </i> mutants , therefore , NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing wt <i> K-Ras </i> and the <i> K-Ras </i> mutations G12V , G12D , G13D , Q61H , L19F , K117N , A146T and R164Q .
Equivalence of plasmid loading was assessed spectrophotometrically and by western blotting for <i> K-Ras </i> ( data not shown ) .
Cells were stained with crystal violet and foci counted 21 days after transfection , as described in Materials and Methods ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref> ) .
No foci were observed in untransfected cells or in cells transfected with wt <i> K-Ras </i> , whereas abundant foci were seen with each hotspot <i> K-Ras </i> mutation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
Codon 12 mutations had slightly greater transforming potential than codon 13 mutations and consistently greater transforming potential than the codon 61 Q61H mutation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3C </xref> ) .
After transfection of additional <i> K-Ras </i> mutations , significant focus formation was observed for codon 117 and 146 mutations ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3B </xref> ) .
In contrast , the codon 164 mutation was phenotypically equivalent to wt <i> K-ras </i> with no evidence of foci formation and the codon 19 mutation generated low but consistent numbers of isolated foci ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3C </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="3"> Ras activating assays </sec-title>
To assess which <i> K-Ras </i> mutations were in the active GTP @-@ bound conformation , a <i> Raf-1 </i> binding assay was carried out as described in Materials and Methods .
<i> Raf-1 </i> selectively binds GTP @-@ bound Ras ( rather than the inactive GDP @-@ bound form ) which , following immunoprecipitation , can be visualised by western blotting .
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref> illustrates the results of our analysis where , consistent with our focus formation experiments , the <i> K-Ras </i> G12V and L19F , K117N and A146T mutations are clearly in the active GTP @-@ bound conformation .
In contrast , the R164Q mutation , like wt <i> K-Ras </i> , was not GTP @-@ bound .
<sec-title level="3"> RNA transcription @-@ profiling experiments </sec-title>
To further compare and contrast the phenotypes associated with each of the <i> K-Ras </i> mutants , transcription @-@ profiling experiments were carried out as described in Materials and Methods .
Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the presence of two major gene clusters , ‘ cluster 1 ' containing the G12V , G12C and G12D mutants and ‘ cluster 2 ' containing G13D , A146T , K117N , R164Q and L19F ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref> ) .
It is interesting to note that the codon 12 mutants were most similar to wt <i> K-Ras </i> , whereas the K117N and A146T mutants clustered with the activating codon 13 and codon 61 hotspot mutants .
The L19F and R164Q mutants formed a subcluster within cluster 2 suggesting , consistent with our foci formation data , that these mutants are phenotypically distinct from the G13D , A146T and K117N mutants .
The presence of L19F in cluster 2 is consistent with our Ras GTPase assay data whereas , in contrast , our experimental data for R164Q predicted a ‘ wt ' Ras phenotype .
The presence of R164Q in cluster 2 , rather than in cluster 1 with wt <i> K-Ras </i> was therefore initially surprising , but suggests that the R164Q mutation also has an ‘ activating ' phenotype , albeit attenuated relative to the other mutations studied .
To further investigate the phenotypes associated with each of the <i> K-Ras </i> mutants , the expression of a diverse selection of genes associated a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction , cytoskeleton remodelling and cell adhesion was compared .
Although further analysis of this complex dataset , including composite analysis of biological pathways and processes is ongoing and will be discussed in more detail in a future manuscript , representative examples of genes showing differential expression following the introduction of each <i> K-Ras </i> mutant are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"> Table 3 </xref>@ .
Consistent with our hierarchical clustering analysis , introduction of the R164Q mutation led to relatively few changes in gene expression or showed reduced pathway activation compared with the other mutants studied .
However , there were examples of genes that were induced by all of the mutants studied , including the protein tyrosine phosphatase <i> Ptpre </i> and the Rho GTPase activating protein <i> Arhgap6 </i> , and multiple examples of genes induced or repressed by all of the mutants with the exception of R164Q .
These included the MAPK phosphatases <i> DUSP4 </i> and <i> DUSP6 </i> , <i> Ereg </i> , <i> Hbegf </i> and <i> Btc </i> , all involved in <i> EGFR </i> binding , the Rho guanine @-@ exchange factor <i> NGEF </i> , cell adhesion molecule <i> Ceacam 1 </i> and plasminogen activator inhibitor <i> Serpinb2 </i>@ .
Consistently , the novel A146T and K117N mutants ( and , to a lesser extent , the L19F mutant ) clustered with and influenced gene expression similarly to the previously described activating G13D and Q61H ‘ hotspot ' mutations .
Of particular interest were genes , for example , <i> Vegfa </i> , <i> Pak3 </i> , <i> Pim1 </i> and <i> EII2 </i> which were differentially expressed by cluster 1 but not cluster 2 mutants , genes , for example , <i> Spry4 </i> , <i> Igf1R </i> , <i> Creb1 </i> and <i> Tcf4 </i> which were differentially expressed by cluster 2 mutants , and additional genes , for example , <i> Jun </i> , <i> E2F2 </i> , <i> Mmp3 </i> and <i> Glut-1 </i> which were differentially regulated by each mutant studied .
<sec-title level="2"> <i> K-Ras </i> gene amplification </sec-title>
To investigate whether altered <i> K-Ras </i> activity could additionally result from gene amplification , a <i> K-Ras </i> gene copy number assay was designed and carried out as described in Materials and Methods and <i> K-Ras </i> copy number compared in normal and tumour tissues .
In total , 2 of the 96 tumour pairs analysed ( 2.1 % ) showed tumour @-@ specific copy number increases ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6 </xref> ) , one ( study code 1264 , wt <i> K-Ras </i> ) with 4 tumour copies of <i> K-Ras </i> and the other ( study code 1233 , wt <i> K-Ras </i> ) with 27 copies of the <i> K-Ras </i> gene .
Assay reproducibility and linearity was demonstrated from the analysis of standard curves generated by serial dilutions of a wide concentration range of input genomic DNA ( data not shown ) .
<i> K-Ras </i> gene amplification was confirmed by FISH analysis as described in Materials and Methods ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref> ) .
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figures 7A and B </xref> illustrate chromosome metaphase spreads confirming FISH probe specificities for chromosomes 12p and 12q , respectively , whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figures 7C and D </xref> show representative colorectal tumour FISH analysis .
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7C </xref> illustrates a tumour sample ( study code 1271 ) in which the <i> K-Ras </i> gene is not amplified ( red fluorescence = green fluorescence ) , whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7D </xref> illustrates a colorectal tumour ( study code 1264 ) with <i> K-Ras </i> gene amplification ( red fluorescence>green fluorescence ) .
Signals from the red 12p12.1 probe in tumour 1264 appear as a cluster of bright dots forming a line which is suggestive of a homogeneously staining region ( HSR ) , a chromosomal region which is amplified either on the original chromosome or on another chromosome , as opposed to double minutes where the amplified gene is located in extra @-@ chromosomal circular DNA molecules .
A rapid , sensitive , reproducible and cost @-@ effective method for mutation profiling of colon cancer and metastatic lymph nodes ( PMID : 20233444 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
Among the 238 common hot @-@ spot cancer mutations in 19 genes interrogated by the OncoCarta panel , mutations were detected in 7 different genes at 26 different nucleotide positions in our colon cancer samples .
Twenty @-@ four assays that detected mutations in more than 1 % of the samples were reconfigured into a new multiplexed panel , termed here as ColoCarta .
Mutation profiling was repeated on 32 mutant samples using ColoCarta and the results were identical to results with OncoCarta , demonstrating that this methodology was reproducible .
Further evidence demonstrating the validity of the data was the fact that the mutation frequencies of the most common colon cancer mutations were similar to the COSMIC ( Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ) database .
The frequencies were 43.5 % for <i> KRAS </i> , 20.1 % for <i> PIK3CA </i> , and 12.1 % for <i> BRAF </i>@ .
In addition , infrequent mutations in <i> NRAS </i> , <i> AKT1 </i> , <i> ABL1 </i> , and <i> MET </i> were detected .
Mutation profiling of metastatic lymph nodes and their corresponding primary tumors showed that they were 89.7 % concordant .
All mutations found in the lymph nodes were also found in the corresponding primary tumors , but in 4 cases a mutation was present in the primary tumor only .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Mutations were detected in control DNAs from intact and FFPETsamples </sec-title>
Previously described mutations in control cell lines were detected .
<i> BRAF </i>@ _V600E , <i> HRAS </i>@ _G12D , <i> NRAS </i>@ _Q61L , <i> PIK3CA </i>@ _E545K , <i> KRAS </i>@ _G13D , <i> NRAS </i>@ _Q61K , <i> EGFR </i>@ 1_S125L , and <i> PIK3CA </i>@ _H1047R were detected in the appropriate cell lines ( A2058 , HS578T , HL60 , MCF7 , MDAMB231 , NCI-H1299 , NCI-H1395 , and UACC-893 , respectively ) .
The appropriate mutation was found in MCF-7 ( <i> PIK3CA </i>@ _E545K ) from both intact DNA and DNA isolated from FFPET .
DNAs from clinical samples , control cell lines , and cell lines formalin @-@ fixed , paraffin @-@ embedded cell lines showed the same rates of primer extension and performance on mass spectrometer .
The proportion of the mutated alleles in each cell line , as observed from the area under the mutant peak on the spectra , ranged from 0.4 @-@ 0.6 , as expected for a pure clonal population with a heterozygote mutation .
Spectra for cell line UACC-893 had equal fractions of mutant and wt alleles ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
One exception to this distribution among cell lines was seen in A2058 , which showed spectra consistent with 2 copies of the WT allele and one mutant <i> BRAF </i> mutant allele ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> ) .
The 3 alleles of <i> BRAF </i> in A2058 are consistent with the observation that there are 3 copies of chromosome 7 in this cell line ( COSMIC in the SNP Array Based LOH and Copy Number Analysis data base ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
<sec-title level="2"> The Sequenom platform was sensitive and quantitative </sec-title>
Pilot studies demonstrated that the assays worked with as little as 1 ng of DNA ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) .
The fraction of unextended primer was .09 even when the input DNA was between 1 @-@ 3 ng , When concentrations of the amount of DNA was between 3 @-@ 14 ng , the fraction of unextended primer was similar , .07 .
Thus , the assays worked well even when only 1 ng of DNA was used .
In clinical samples with some assays it was possible to detect mutations that only represented 5 % of the total 2 peak areas .
The spectra in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref> show a small but clear peak at the expected size for a <i> PIK3CA </i> 1047R mutation in a lymph node .
We also were able to demonstrate the sensitivity of the platform by performing a cell mixing experiment .
Mutation analysis was done using MCF-7 cell line DNA alone or mixed with SKBR3 at various percentages .
MCF-7 cells contain a PIK3CA mutation , and SKBR3 cells do not .
Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> demonstrates that the mutation was detectable even when the MCF-7 cells represented only 5 to 10 % of the total DNA and only 5 to 2.5 % of the alleles .
This sensitivity is important for mutation detection in clinical cancer samples , which usually contain some amount of normal tissue , which dilutes the number of tumor cells .
This is of particular concern when profiling lymph nodes , which may contain a minority of tumor cells .
<sec-title level="2"> Frequencies of C-07 mutations in <i> KRAS </i> , <i> NRAS </i> , <i> PIK3CA </i> , and <i> BRAF </i> detected with OncoCarta and the Sequenom platform were similar to previous reports </sec-title>
In this preliminary assessment of the feasibility of using the Sequenom platform to do large @-@ scale mutation profiling of colon cancer samples isolated from FFPET , it was essential to determine if our data yielded frequencies typical of what has been seen previously .
Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> shows the mutation frequencies obtained here and from the COSMIC ( Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ) database [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
The COSMIC frequencies seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> are based only on those mutations that are detectable with OncoCarta .
OncoCarta assays interrogate 99 % , 98 % , and 78 % of the known colon cancer mutations in <i> BRAF </i> , <i> KRAS </i> , and <i> PIK3CA </i> , respectively , based on a large number of colon cancer samples that have been sequenced in <i> BRAF </i> ( n = 4628 ) , <i> KRAS </i> ( n = 858 ) and <i> PIK3CA </i> ( n = 247 ) .
The OncoCarta panel found that the most frequent mutations in C-07 were <i> KRAS </i> ( 43.5 % ) , <i> PIK3CA </i> ( 20.1 % ) , and <i> BRAF </i> ( 12.1 % ) , which are similar to what is seen in COSMIC .
<i> NRAS </i> mutations , while infrequent , were detected in codons 12 , 13 and 61 and represent a sizable minority of the C0 @-@ 7 samples ( 3.8 % ) .
These data suggest that FFPET samples can be interrogated with the technology described here and yield accurate data .
While most of the specific amino acid mutations mirror what is seen on the COSMIC database , some unique colon cancer gene mutations were found , which include <i> ABL1 </i>@ -@ F359V , <i> AKT1 @- </i>@ E17K , <i> MET @- </i>@ R970C , and <i> MET </i>@ -@ T992I .
Other amino acid changes that were not in the COSMIC database were amino acid changes R88Q , H701P , and C420R in <i> PIK3CA </i> , <i> BRAF </i>@ -@ 594V @/@ G , and <i> KRAS </i>@ -@ Q61R , and several in <i> NRAS </i> , including G12C , G12D , G13R , G13V , Q61H and Q61K ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> MET mutations were found in C0 @-@ 7 and amplified in sometumors </sec-title>
<i> MET </i> mutations were found in 3.3 % of C-07 samples .
Interestingly , these mutations were not only unexpected in their appearance within the colon cancer population but also the frequency within the samples was unexpected .
In four of the eight samples with <i> MET </i> mutations , the mutant alleles were present at 58 @-@ 70 % , suggesting an amplification of the mutant allele or a loss of the wt gene ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
Amplification may represent the best explanation , in that amplification of the <i> MET </i> genomic region , 7q31 , has been observed in the Progenetix CGH Database in 23 % of colorectal cancers [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref>@ ]
<sec-title level="2"> Sequenom data was reproducible </sec-title>
Most of the assays in the OncoCarta panel did not detect mutations or the frequency of mutations was very low ( below 1 % ) in our colon cancer samples .
OncoCarta assays interrogate mutations in these 19 genes listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref>@ .
To reduce the cost , time and the amount of DNA required for profiling , only 24 assays , which detected mutations at a frequency of 1 % or greater in C-07 , were selected , resorted in 6 pools and included in a new panel , termed ColoCarta ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3"> 3 </xref> ) .
Mutation profiles of 32 mutant samples with 41 mutations were repeated with the ColoCarta .
The mutations detected by the 2 panels ( OncoCarta and ColoCarta ) were identical , demonstrating the reproducibility of the methodology .
<sec-title level="2"> Multiple mutation frequencies suggest an order to the acquisition of different mutations </sec-title>
A majority of the tumors ( 64 % ) contained at least one or more mutations in the following genes : <i> BRAF </i> , <i> KRAS </i> , <i> NRAS </i> , <i> MET </i> , or <i> PIK3CA </i> , and 18 % had 2 or more mutations .
The most common double mutation was in <i> KRAS </i> and <i> PIK3CA </i> , followed by <i> PIK3CA </i> and <i> BRAF </i> ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> ) .
Most samples with <i> PIK3CA </i> mutations ( 80 % ) also had mutations in other genes , the most frequent of which was <i> KRAS </i> ; other mutated genes were <i> BRAF </i> , <i> MET </i> , <i> NRAS </i> , and a second <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> , last column ) .
Tumors with <i> MET </i> and <i> NRAS </i> mutations also have an unexpectedly high frequency of co-occurring mutations , which suggests that they occur as a second mutation and perhaps later in the etiology of the tumor .
Many tumors contain only a <i> KRAS </i> or <i> BRAF </i> mutation , which is consistent with previous reports finding these mutations in earlier stages of colon cancer [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
The multiple mutation frequencies for tumors with <i> KRAS </i> and <i> PIK3CA </i> or with <i> PIK3CA </i> and <i> BRAF </i> were slightly higher and lower , respectively , than expected based on their individual frequencies ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> ) .
Conversely , the expected double mutation frequency of <i> BRAF </i> and <i> KRAS </i> would be 5.1 % , based on our data , but this combination was not found , also in agreement with previous reports [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Primary tumors with KRAS and PIK3CA mutations vary with respect to the frequency of these mutant alleles </sec-title>
In the samples with co-occurring mutations , the ratios of <i> KRAS </i> mutation ratio ( <i> KRAS </i> mutation peak area @/@ total peak area ) to the <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation ratio ( <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation peak area @/@ total peak area ) was determined .
Twenty @-@ two out of 31 samples ( 71 % ) had <i> KRAS </i>@ / @<i> PIK3CA </i> ratios above 1.25 ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5"> 5 </xref> ) .
<i> PIK3CA </i> mutations were more prevalent in only 2 out of 31 samples .
These differences demonstrate that in a majority of primary tumors with double mutations in <i> KRAS </i> and <i> PIK3CA </i> , the <i> KRAS </i> mutations are more prevalent than the <i> PIK3CA </i>@ .
This unequal distribution of mutant alleles within a tumor may be due to the fact that a majority of the tumor cells have only the <i> KRAS </i> mutation , and cells with a <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation are in the minority , or it could be due to copy number variations in the <i> KRAS </i> and <i> PIK3CA </i> loci .
<sec-title level="2"> BRAF mutations were correlated with poorly differentiated tumors and with mucinous tumors </sec-title>
The frequency of mutations for <i> KRAS </i> , <i> PIK3CA </i> , and <i> BRAF </i> were tested for correlation to the degree of differentiation and to the prevalence of mucin in the tumor .
<i> BRAF </i> mutations were found in 26.2 % of the poorly differentiated tumors and in 8.2 % of the moderate and well differentiated .
These frequencies were significantly different by Chi square test ( p value = 0.001 ) .
<i> BRAF </i> mutations were also associated with mucinous tumors : <i> BRAF </i> mutations occurred in 28 % of grade 3 mucinous tumors ( > 50 % mucinous tumor cells ) but in only 9.4 % of the non @-@ mucinous tumors ( grade 1 and 2 ) .
This was significant by the Chi square test at p value = 0.006 .
Similar data have been reported previously [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref>@ ] .
<i> KRAS </i> and <i> PIK3CA </i> mutations did not correlate with either the degree of differentiation or with prevalence of mucinous cells .
<sec-title level="2"> Mutation profiling demonstrated a majority of primary and lymph node samples were concordant but differences were detected </sec-title>
Lymph node metastases were not routinely collected in C-07 but as a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using lymph nodes for mutation profiling was conducted .
We isolated DNA from 39 lymph nodes containing tumor cells and their corresponding primary tumors .
These primary and lymph nodes samples were profiled with the entire OncoCarta panel .
The majority of lymph nodes and their corresponding primary tumors ( 89.7 % ) were concordant .
A total of 26 mutations were detected in lymph nodes , including <i> KRAS </i> , <i> BRAF </i> , <i> PIK3CA </i> , and <i> NRAS </i>@ .
Thirty @-@ five out of 39 lymph nodes had identical mutation profiles , but in 4 cases mutations in the primary tumors were not found in the corresponding lymph nodes ( <i> BRAF </i> [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref>@ ] , <i> PIK3CA </i> [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"> 1 </xref>@ ] and <i> KRAS </i> [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"> 1 </xref>@ ] ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Mutation profiles demonstrate that tumor cell populations may be different in lymph nodes and in the primary tumors </sec-title>
Peak area evaluation of tumors that had 2 mutations and for which a metastatic lymph node was available demonstrated differences between the primary and lymph node samples .
Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6"> 6 </xref> details the frequency of mutant and wt alleles based on the peak areas for 5 such samples .
<i> KRAS </i> to <i> PIK3CA </i> ratios demonstrated that there were more <i> KRAS </i> mutations than <i> PIK3CA </i> mutations in 4 of 4 primary samples , and in 3 of the 4 lymph node samples .
However , it is also notable that the ratio of <i> KRAS </i>@ /PIK3A was lower in the lymph node compared to their primary tumor in 3 out of 4 samples .
In sample 0940 , the <i> KRAS </i>@ / @<i> PIK3CA </i> mutation decreased by almost 1 @/@ 2 in the lymph node tumor compared to the primary .
Thus , in these samples there is either a loss of <i> KRAS </i> mutations or an accumulation of <i> PIK3CA </i> mutations , suggesting that <i> PIK3CA </i> mutations may impart a selective advantage in the lymph node .
In contrast , two other samples have a less frequent occurrence of their <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation in the lymph node than in the primary tumor .
In sample 2244 , the <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation was undetectable in the lymph node ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6"> 6 </xref> ) .
In fact , if there was a selection for both mutations in the lymph node , then the <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation frequency would have been the same as that of the <i> KRAS </i> mutation ( 0.15 ) .
On the other hand , if the <i> PIK3CA </i>@ / @<i> KRAS </i> ratio were the same in the primary and lymph node tumor , then the <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation frequency would have been .08 , which is still detectable with this technology ( Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) .
Thus , in sample 2244 there were fewer <i> PIK3CA </i> mutant alleles in the lymph node than in the primary tumor .
In sample 1837 , mutations in both <i> BRAF </i> and <i> PIK3CA </i> were detected and the <i> BRAF </i>@ / @<i> PIK3CA </i> ratio was 1.67 , but increased to 4.4 in the metastatic lymph node .
HER3 and downstream pathways are involved in colonization of brain metastases from breast cancer ( PMID : 20604919 )
Results
Most brain metastases were triple negative and basal @-@ like .
The brain metastases over-expressed one or more members of the HER family and in particular HER3 was significantly over-expressed relative to matched primary tumors .
Brain metastases from breast and other primary sites , and metastases to multiple organs in the autopsied cases , also contained somatic mutations in EGFR , HRAS , KRAS , NRAS or PIK3CA .
This paralleled the frequent activation of AKT and MAPK pathways .
In particular , activation of the MAPK pathway was increased in the brain metastases compared to the primary tumors .
Results
Clinical and pathological features
The median age at diagnosis was 48.5 years and the median time for the development of brain metastasis was 3.5 years .
All but one of the series of primary breast cancers and all brain metastases were grade 3 invasive ductal carcinomas @-@ no specific type ( IDC @-@ NST ) [ 29 ] .
The remaining tumor pair was a grade 2 mucinous carcinoma .
The autopsy samples comprised four grade 3 and one grade 2 IDC @-@ NST .
ER , PgR , HER2 , ' Basal ' markers and stem cell markers ( non @-@ autopsy cases )
Immunohistochemistry data are summarized in Figure 1A , B ( see also additional file 2 , Table S1 and Figure S1 ) .
It was noteworthy that 60 % and 76 % of the tumors were negative for ER and PR , respectively , with complete concordance between primary and metastases .
Seventy @-@ seven percent ( 77 % ) and 81 % of the unmatched brain metastases were also ER and PR negative , respectively .
Twenty percent ( 20 % ) and 19 % of the primary breast tumors and metastases , respectively , had correlated over-expression of HER2 ( 3+ staining ) and all of these showed gene amplification using CISH .
Twenty percent ( 20 % ) of the unmatched metastases were also HER2+.
Fifty @-@ six percent ( 56 % ) of the primary tumors and 48 % of the matched metastases were triple negative and of these , 60 % were positive for at least one of the basal markers respectively ( CK14 , CK5 @/@ CK6 , CK17 , EGFR and SMA ) .
Overall , 54 % of the primary and 60 % of the metastases were of basal phenotype ( irrespective of ER , PR and HER2 status ) , confirming enrichment in this cohort over the normal distribution in breast cancer [ 8 ] .
Noteworthy , EGFR staining was seen mainly in the periphery of the tumor where there was contact with non @-@ neoplastic brain parenchyma [ 30 ] .
A higher proportion of brain metastases had a putative stem cell @-@ like phenotype ( CD44+ @/@ CD24- ) compared to the primaries , 55 % versus 25 % , ( Figure 1A ) .
Fifty @-@ one percent ( 51 % ) of the primary tumors had a Ki-67 index higher than 10 % in contrast to matched and unmatched metastases that had 86 % and 85 % of samples with index higher than 10 % .
Gene expression profiling
The availability of good quality RNA and stringent filtering of the DASL data yielded gene expression profiling data on 37 @/@ 61 brain metastases from breast cancer ( 15 @/@ 39 from matched pairs and 22 @/@ 22 from unmatched metastases ) and 15 matched primaries .
Unsupervised analysis highlighted a strong similarity between primary tumors and their matched metastases ( Figure 2A ) .
Only 20 genes were differentially expressed between the matched primaries and metastases .
This may be a consequence of the overall strong similarity between primaries and metastases [ 31 ] coupled with the sample size ( n = 30 ) and number of genes analyzed ( n = 512 cancer genes in the DASL panel ) [ 32 ] .
Comparison between primaries and all metastases ( matched and unmatched ) identified 27 statistically significant , differentially expressed genes ( Figure 2B ) .
Supplementary Figure 2 ( see Additional file 2 , Figure S2 ) depicts principal component analysis showing good separation of the primaries and metastases using this 27 @-@ gene list .
All 20 genes identified in the matched pair analysis were part of this 27 @-@ gene set .
Among this 20 @-@ gene set , were HER3 and one of its downstream target molecules GRB2 [ 33 ] , hypoxia related molecule HIF1-alfa , MAPKinase cascade related protein CREBBP , cell cycle regulator RB1 and proliferation related genes CCNH , CDK7 and CDC25B .
Since the brain is rich in neuregulin 1 [ 34,35 ] and this is a ligand for HER3 , we hypothesized that the neuregulin @-@ HER3 activation was important in allowing breast cancer cells to colonize the brain .
HER family receptors and downstream molecules expression
HER3 , EGFR , HER2 , HER4 and HIF1-alfa expression was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR ( see Additional file 2 , Figure S3 ) in 12 matched breast @/@ brain samples for which DASL data and RNA were available .
Similar to the DASL data , 10 cases showed increased fold change by RT-PCR of HER3 gene expression relative to their matched primaries ranging from 1.12 to 5.8 and with an average of 2.4 .
Immunohistochemistry for HER3 was similar , showing positivity in 11 @/@ 37 ( 29.7 % ) of the primary tumors , 22 @/@ 37 ( 59 % ) of the matched metastases and 13 @/@ 21 ( 62 % ) of the unmatched brain metastases ( P = 0.019 ) .
In agreement , phosphorylated HER3 confirmed more frequent activation in the brain metastases , with positivity in 14 @/@ 37 ( 37 % ) of the primary tumors , 24 @/@ 37 ( 64 % ) of the matched metastases and 18 @/@ 21 ( 85 % ) of the unmatched brain metastases ( P = 0.046 ) ( see Additional file 2 , Table S1 and Figure S1 ) .
Immunohistochemistry for GRB2 , HIF1-alfa and phosphorylated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , JNK1 @/@ JNK2 , ERK5 and p38 also demonstrated increased activation in the metastases compared to the primary tumors ; ( see Additional file 2 , Table S1 and Figure S1 ) .
In contrast , phosphorylated AKT was equally high in both the primaries and metastases ( see Additional file 2 , Table S1 ) .
Interestingly , the non @-@ breast derived brain metastases showed similarly high activation of the MAPK pathway together with over-expression ( 3+ stain ) of EGFR ( in 9 @/@ 11 ( 81 % ) metastases ( a prostate and one colon carcinoma did not ) but in the absence of HER3 activation ( 0 @/@ 11 ) ( see Additional file 2 , Table S1 ) .
Somatic mutation analysis
OncoCarta analysis identified mutations in the brain metastases from primary breast cancers ( non @-@ autopsy cases ) in NRAS ( 2 @/@ 12 - 17 % ) , and PIK3CA ( 2 @/@ 12 - 17 % ) ( Table 1 and Figure 3 ) .
Mutations were also identified in brain metastases from non @-@ breast primaries in EGFR ( 3 @/@ 9 - 33 % ; two lung and one kidney ) , HRAS ( 1 @/@ 9 - 11 % ; lung ) , KRAS ( 2 @/@ 9 - 22 % ; one colon and one lung ) , NRAS ( 3 @/@ 9 - 33 % ; two lung and one kidney ) and PIK3CA ( 2 @/@ 9 - 22 % ; one melanoma and one lung ) .
Mutant Allele Proportions ( MAPs ) ranged from 9 % to 80 % .
All these mutations were validated by immunohistochemistry ( using a specific antibody raised against the protein with the EGFR E746_A750 del mutation ) or sequencing except for one each in EGFR , HRAS ( validated by iPLEX ) , NRAS and PIC3CA ( validated by HRM ) , where the estimated mutant allele proportion was less than 15 % , and two in PIK3CA in which there was insufficient good quality DNA remaining to obtain sequence data .
EGFR G719 S appeared to be found frequently by OncoCarta but could not be detected by iPLEX , using independent PCR and extension primers .
The OncoCarta false @-@ positive result appeared to be due to hairpin formation of the extension primer that occurred frequently when archival DNA was used as a template , and the yield was low .
Except for one EGFR mutation ( Case #13 ; Table 1 ) , the same somatic mutations were observed in the brain metastases with similar MAPs as in the matched primary breast tumors .
It was noteworthy that the four matched pairs harboring somatic mutation in NRAS or PIK3CA also overexpressed a member of the HER family .
For example , matched pair #2 had a mutation in NRAS and showed over-expression of HER3 , matched pair #7 had a mutation in NRAS and showed over-expression of HER1 , matched pair #9 had a mutation in PIK3CA and amplification of HER2 and matched pair #10 had a mutation in PIK3CA and overexpression of HER1 ( Table 1 ) .
Among the autopsy samples of cases with primary breast cancer , we found mutations in EGFR in one liver and one lymph node metastases , and a mutation in PIK3CA in all the samples from one case , and in a liver metastasis from another ( see Additional file 2 , Table S2 ) .
One EGFR and one PIK3CA mutation could be verified by sequencing or immunohistochemistry but lack of good quality DNA , and additional mutation @-@ specific antibodies , prohibited validation of the others .
All the samples from one case had the same mutation at similar MAPs ( PIK3CA H1074R in Patient #2 ) .
We identified HRAS and PIK3CA mutations in the basal breast cancer cell lines SUM 159 and BT20 .
The mutations with MAPs > 25 % have been reported before [ 19,20 ] : HRAS G12 D ( MAP 53.2 % in SUM159 ) and PIK3CA H1047L ( MAP 50.0 % in SUM159 ) and P539R ( MAP 43.8 % in BT20 ) but we also identified HRAS Q61K at MAP 24.6 % in SUM159 and HRAS Q61K at MAP 14.1 % , and PIK3CA H1047R at MAP 44.4 % in BT20 .
In addition , we were also able to show that all of the mutations with MAPs > 25 % were present in mammospheres derived from these cell lines .
Cell type @-@ specific anti @-@ cancer properties of valproic acid : independent effects on HDAC activity and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation ( PMID : 20663132 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
VPA induced significant histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibition in most of the cell lines , but the degree of inhibition was highly cell type @-@ specific .
Moreover , cell growth , motility and the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation were inhibited , activated , or unaffected by VPA in a cell type @-@ specific manner .
Importantly , no relationship was found between the effects of VPA on HDAC inhibition and changes in the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation , cell growth , or motility .
In contrast , VPA @-@ induced modulation of the MAPK pathway downstream of Ras but upstream of MEK ( i.e. , at the level of Raf ) was important for changes in cell speed .

<sec-title level="2"> Effects of VPA on the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation and histone H3 acetylation </sec-title>
Erk1 @/@ Erk2 activity was investigated in 10 cell lines , including BT4C , BT4Cn , U87MG , N2a , PC12 @-@ E2 , CSML0 , CSML100 , HeLa , Swiss 3T3 and L929 , by estimating the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation by immunoblotting .
In the absence of VPA , BT4C , BT4Cn , U87MG , and PC12 @-@ E2 exhibited high Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation levels .
L929 , Swiss 3T3 and CSML0 exhibited intermediate levels , and N2a , CSML100 and HeLa exhibited low levels ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1a </xref> ) .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1b </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1c </xref> show the relative changes in the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation in the respective cell lines in response to VPA ( 3 mM , 48 h ) .
Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation was significantly decreased in CSML0 and L929 , significantly increased in CSML100 , BT4Cn and N2a , and not significantly affected in BT4C , U87MG , PC12 @-@ E2 , HeLa and Swiss 3T3 .
VPA is a known HDAC inhibitor .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1d </xref> shows the degree of acetylation of histone H3 in the 10 cell lines under control conditions determined by immunoblotting .
All cell lines exhibited low acetylation levels under control conditions ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1d </xref> ) .
VPA significantly increased the degree of acetylation in 8 of the 10 cell lines ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1e </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1f </xref> ) .
The changes in acetylation ranged from an approximately three @-@ fold increase ( U87MG ) to an ~ 13 @-@ fold increase ( BT4C ; <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1e </xref> ) .
In conclusion , VPA has highly cell type @-@ specific effects on the degree of HDAC inhibition and on changes in the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation .
Furthermore , the effects of VPA on the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation and HDAC inhibition were not related to the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation and acetylation in the absence of the drug .
Finally , no relationship was found between the effects of VPA on HDAC inhibition and the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation .
Thus , VPA @-@ induced changes in the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation can not be explained by the effects of the drug on HDAC activity , although HDAC inhibition may contribute to the observed effects .
<sec-title level="2"> Effects of VPA on cell growth </sec-title>
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> shows that VPA dose @-@ dependently changed the growth of all investigated cell lines .
Nine cell lines exhibited IC @<sub> 25 </sub> values ranging from 0.43 to 1.83 mM ( <bold> Table </bold> <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) , whereas the growth of a single cell line , U87MG , was significantly elevated upon exposure to 0.75 mM VPA .
A correlation analysis of the data presented in <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> revealed no significant correlations between the effects of VPA on HDAC inhibition and cell growth or between the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation and cell growth ( <bold> Figure S4 </bold> ) .
However , four of the five cell lines that did not demonstrate significant changes in the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation in response to VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1b </xref> ) did not have IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values for growth within the tested concentration range ( below 3 mM ; <bold> Table </bold> <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) , whereas all five cell lines demonstrating significant changes in the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation in response to VPA had IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values for growth below 3 mM .
These results demonstrate a significant relationship between the effects of VPA o the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation and cell growth ( p < 0.05 , Fisher 's exact test ) .
In conclusion , VPA induced highly cell type @-@ specific effects on cell growth .
Furthermore , no apparent relationship was observed between the effects of VPA on HDAC inhibition and cell growth , whereas VPA was likely to affect the growth of a given cell type if it affected the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation in that cell type at physiologically relevant concentrations .
<sec-title level="2"> Effects of VPA on individual cell motility and the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation in L929 cells </sec-title>
Erk1 @/@ Erk2 are known to regulate cell motility [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
In L929 cells , VPA inhibits the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> ) and cell speed [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , a potential relationship between the effects of VPA on the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation and cell motility was investigated further in L929 cells .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3a </xref> shows time @-@ dependent effects of 3 mM VPA on the mean @-@ cell speed of L929 cells .
The speed was significantly reduced after 1 h exposure to the drug .
After 24 @-@ 48 h exposure , further reductions in cell speed were observed .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3b </xref> shows data from the time @-@ response experiments , in which VPA was directly added to the culture medium during the motility recordings .
Using this approach , a reduction in cell displacement was observed for VPA @-@ treated cells ~ 20 min after drug addition compared with control cultures .
These observations demonstrate that VPA caused biphasic , time @-@ related inhibition of the cell speed of L929 cells , characterized by an initial , rapid inhibition followed by a further inhibition at later time @-@ points .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3c </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3e </xref> show time @-@ response effects of VPA on the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation .
A 1 h exposure to 3 mM VPA significantly decreased the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation .
After 6 and 24 h , the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation decreased further .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3d </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3f </xref> show dose @-@ response curves of the effects of VPA on Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation .
VPA dose @-@ dependently inhibited the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation , with estimated IC @<sub> 25 </sub> and IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values of ~ 0.24 and 0.58 mM , respectively .
A comparison of <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3a </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3d </xref> revealed that the time @-@ course of the effects of VPA on the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation resembled that observed for the inhibition of cell speed , suggesting that VPA partially modulated cell speed through modulation of the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation .
Following the studies of L929 cells , the motility of the remaining nine cell lines was investigated .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref> shows that VPA significantly and dose @-@ dependently inhibited the speed of N2a , U87MG and PC12 @-@ E2 cells , stimulated the speed of BT4Cn cells , and did not affect the speed of the remaining five cell lines ( BT4C , CSML0 , CSML100 , HeLa and Swiss 3T3 ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Effects of VPA on individual cell motility by modulation of signal transduction upstream of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 </sec-title>
The GTPase Ras is an upstream activator of the MAPK pathway [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"> 11 </xref>@ ] .
To determine whether VPA modulated the MAPK pathway upstream or downstream of Ras , the effects of VPA were investigated in L929 cells expressing constitutively active Ras ( caRas ) .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5a </xref> shows micrographs of L929 cells not expressing or expressing caRas and grown in the presence or absence of VPA .
Control @-@ transfected cells adopted a stellate phenotype with an increased area when treated with VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5a </xref> , two leftmost images ) , whereas caRas @-@ expressing cells were more round and loosely attached ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5a </xref> , two topmost images ) , a typical phenotype of Ras @-@ transformed cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref>@ ] .
However , exposure of caRas @-@ expressing cells to VPA caused them to adopt a phenotype similar to control @-@ transfected cells treated with VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5a </xref> , two rightmost images ) .
The immunoblot presented in <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5b </xref> shows that L929 cells expressing caRas exhibited higher degrees of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation than control @-@ transfected cells when grown in the absence of VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5b </xref> , lanes 2 and 1 ) .
However , VPA caused equally strong inhibition of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation in control @- and caRas @-@ transfected cells ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5b </xref> , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
These results demonstrate that exposure to VPA reversed the effects of caRas expression on L929 cell morphology and the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation .
Cells expressing caRas did not move significantly faster than control @-@ transfected cells when grown in the absence of VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5c </xref> ) .
The speed of control @- and caRas @-@ transfected cells was similarly inhibited in the presence of VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5c </xref> ) .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5d </xref> shows the effects of VPA exposure on the speed of L929 cells expressing constitutively active MEK2 ( caMEK2 ) .
Cells expressing caMEK2 did not move significantly faster than control @-@ transfected cells grown in the absence of VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5d </xref> , p < 0.063 ) .
However , in the presence of VPA , caMEK2 @-@ expressing cells moved significantly faster than control @-@ transfected cells exposed to VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5d </xref> , p < 0.029 ) .
Moreover , the speed of caMEK2 @-@ expressing cells was not significantly reduced after exposure to VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5d </xref> , column 4 vs. column 2 ) .
To determine whether VPA affected the speed of BT4Cn cells through effects on the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation , the effects of VPA were investigated in BT4Cn cells expressing dominant @-@ negative Ras ( dnRas ) .
The expression of dnRas was verified by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti @-@ Ras antibody .
As shown in <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5e </xref> , Ras immunoreactivity was increased in cells transfected with the dnRas expression vector , indicating that the cells expressed dnRas .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5f </xref> shows that exposure of BT4Cn cells to 3 mM VPA for 24 h , but not 4 h , significantly increased the speed of both control @- and dnRas @-@ transfected cells .
Thus , the expression of dnRas was not able to prevent the VPA @-@ induced increase in the speed of BT4Cn cells .
<bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5g </xref> shows an immunoblot of BT4Cn cells treated or untreated with VPA and @/@ or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 .
As expected , VPA increased the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation compared with untreated cells ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5g </xref> , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
However , this stimulation was prevented by treating the cells with PD98059 ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5g </xref> , lane 4 ) .
Similarly , treatment of BT4Cn cells with VPA increased the cell speed compared with untreated cells ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5h </xref> , columns 1 and 3 ) .
However , the VPA @-@ induced increase of the cell speed was completely prevented by PD98059 ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5h </xref> , column 3 vs. column 4 ) , which reduced the speed of VPA @-@ treated cells to the level of control cells untreated with VPA and PD98059 ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5h </xref> , columns 1 and 4 ) .
The same concentration of PD98059 did not significantly reduce the speed of cells untreated with VPA ( <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5h </xref> , columns 1 and 2 ) .
In conclusion , the data presented in <bold> Figure </bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5a-h </xref> demonstrate that VPA in L929 and BT4Cn cells modulates cell motility , cell morphology and the degree of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation by altering signaling through the MAPK pathway downstream of Ras but upstream of MEK ( i.e. , at the level of Raf ) .
Regulation of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 activation by osteopontin in PC3 human prostate cancer cells ( PMID : 20868520 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
Here , our studies demonstrate that OPN can activate Akt either through the α @<sub> V </sub>@ β @<sub> 3 </sub> integrin or the CD44 cell surface receptor .
Members of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) family have been shown to be up-regulated in a variety of human cancers and have been implicated in the metastatic behavior .
Our studies have demonstrated an increase in the phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser259 and Ser338 in PC3 cells over-expressing OPN .
This increase matches up with the Erk1 @/@ Erk2 phosphorylation at Thr202 @/@ Thr204 and activation .
However , the inhibition of Akt activity augments the phosphorylation state of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 to two to three fold with a concomitant reduction in the phosphorylation state of c-Raf at Ser259 .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Osteopontin induces Erk1 @/@ Erk2 activation </sec-title>
We measured the phosphorylation state of the three most widely known members of the mitogen @-@ activated kinase ( MAPK ) family proteins including Erk1 @/@ Erk2 , JNK , or p38 MAPK in PC3 cells over expressing OPN ( PC3 @/@ OPN ) .
Stable PC3 @/@ OPN cells were generated as described previously [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref>@ ] .
PC3 @/@ OPN stable cell lines display an increased expression of OPN compared with stable PC3 cell lines expressing empty vector ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> , lane 2 ) .
Previous studies have shown that metastatic PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells have relatively low levels of active Erk1 @/@ Erk2 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref>@ ] .
Western blot analysis with indicated phosphor @-@ specific antibody was performed .
Consistent with those findings , we show here that PC3 cells expressing pCEP4 vector ( henceforth represented as PC3 ) displayed either minimal or barely detectable levels of phosphorylation of Erk 1 @/@ 2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> , lane 1 ) .
The phosphorylation is increased to a greater extent in PC3 @/@ OPN cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> , lane 2 ) .
An increase in the phosphorylation at Thr 202 @/@ 204 represents the activation of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 in PC3 @/@ OPN cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> , lane 2 ) .
Confocal analysis of PC3 and PC3 @/@ OPN cells stained for phospho @-@ Erk1 @/@ Erk2 also revealed a robust and diffuse staining of activated Erk1 @/@ Erk2 in PC3 @/@ OPN cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1E </xref> , bottom middle panel ) .
An increased staining substantiates the activation of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 in PC3 @/@ OPN cells since staining was performed with phosphor @-@ Erk1 @/@ Erk2 antibody .
PC3 cells show sparse staining of phospho @- Erk1 @/@ Erk2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1E </xref> , Top middle panel , green ) .
This is consistent with the immunoblotting analysis shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> which demonstrates a decrease in the phosphorylation and activation of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 in PC3 cells .
Actin staining was used to demonstrate the cell periphery .
Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated a small increase in the phosphorylation of JNK at Threonine 183 and Tyrosine 185 in PC3 @/@ OPN cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> , lane 2 ) .
Furthermore , OPN had a very negligible effect on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at Thr180 @/@ Tyr182 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> , lane 2 ) .
GAPDH was used as a loading control when probing total OPN expression levels ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ; lower panel ) .
There were no observed differences in the protein levels of non @-@ phosphorylated MAPK family members in either PC3 or PC3 @/@ OPN cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B-D </xref> ; lower panels ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Osteopontin induced Erk1 @/@ Erk2 activation occurs through c-Raf and MEK1 @/@ MEK2 </sec-title>
Raf and MEK have been shown to be the upstream regulators of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"> 17 </xref>@ ] .
In order to determine the role of Raf and MEK1 @/@ MEK2 in OPN @-@ mediated activation of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 , western blot analysis was employed .
Structures of the Raf proteins ( A-Raf , B-Raf , and c-Raf ) have been shown to be similar , but the proteins maintain differences in how they are activated and how they activate downstream targets such as MEK1 @/@ MEK2 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"> 17 </xref>@ ] .
Activation of A-Raf and B-Raf is represented by the phosphorylation at Ser 299 and 245 , respectively .
Activation of c-Raf is measured by phosphorylation at Ser 338 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
Phosphorylation of A-Raf was almost not detected in PC3 and PC3 @/@ OPN cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
Conversely , PC3 cells exhibited a higher basal level phosphorylation of B-Raf at Ser445 in PC3 cells ( lane 1 ) and OPN expression had no effect in increasing the phosphorylation state of B-Raf ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> , lane 2 ) .
However , activation of c-Raf appears to highly dependent on OPN over-expression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2C </xref> , lane 2 ) .
An increase in the phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338 suggests that activation of c-Raf may have a role in the OPN @-@ dependent Raf @/@ MEK @/@ ERK pathway and control apoptosis .
Therefore we next proceed to investigate the activation of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 in response to OPN over-expression .
MEK1 @/@ MEK2 activation is characterized by phosphorylation at two activation loop residues , Ser 217 and Ser 221 .
We found an increase in the activation of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 in PC3 @/@ OPN cells as compared to PC3 control cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2D </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Akt negatively regulate Erk 1 @/@ 2 activation in PC3 @/@ OPN cells </sec-title>
Recent observations have demonstrated an increase in the activation of Akt in PC3 @/@ OPN cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"> 6 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] .
Little is known about the role of Akt in the Erk pathway in PC3 cells .
Therefore , we have investigated the effects of Akt inhibitor on the phosphorylation of c-Raf and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 on Thr202 @/@ Thr204 .
OPN expression in PC3 cells increased Akt activation , as measured the phosphorylation of ser473 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> , lane 2 ) .
Serine 259 of c-Raf has been shown to be regulated by Akt .
Its phosphorylation provides a docking site for the cytosolic protein 14-3-3 and the subsequent inhibition of c-Raf activation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"> 17 </xref>@ ] .
OPN , presumably through Akt induces the phosphorylation of c-Raf at ser259 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
PC3 cells treated with Akt inhibitor showed an almost undetectable amount of c-Raf phosphorylation at ser259 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3C </xref> , lane 2 ) when compared with vehicle treated PC3 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3C </xref> , lane 1 ) .
In order to more fully understand the role of OPN in c-Raf activation and its association with Akt , the activation of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and c-Raf was studied in the presence of Akt inhibitor ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3D </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3E </xref> ) .
In the presence of an Akt inhibitor , PC3 @/@ OPN cells displayed a further increase in phosphorylation of c-Raf at Ser338 ( lane 4 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1D </xref> ) and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 at Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3E </xref> , lane 4 ) as measured by immunoblotting analyses with respective phospho @-@ specific antibody .
These results indicate that while OPN ultimately activates c-Raf and Erk1 @/@ Erk2 , its activation of Akt plays an inhibitory role through the increased phosphorylation of c-Raf Serine 259 , a known docking site for 14-3-3 protein .
<sec-title level="2"> OPN induces activation of Akt through both α @<sub> V </sub>@ β @<sub> 3 </sub> integrins and the CD44 cell surface receptor </sec-title>
Integrin αvβ3 and CD44 are receptors of osteopontin and CD44 is frequently over expressed in cancer cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"> 13 </xref>@ ] .
To assess whether both the CD44 and αVβ3 receptors have a role in OPN @- mediated Akt activation , we used a specific inhibitor ( cyclo RGD ; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4D </xref> ) to the αVβ3 integrin and siRNA to CD44 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> ) .
PC3 cells over expressing OPN with a mutation in the integrin binding domain RGDΔRGA ( referred to as PC3 @/@ RGA ) and thus no longer able to activate integrins were used to further define the individual roles of αVβ3 integrin and CD44 in the activation of Akt .
The expression levels OPN and OPN ( RGA ) in these cell lines were shown previously .
We do not see any differences in the molecular mass of cellular or secreted OPN in PC3 , PC3 @/@ OPN or PC3 @/@ OPN ( RGA ) cells .
The molecular mass of native OPN protein is approximately 30 @-@ 36 kDa .
These cells express ~ 60 @-@ 68 kDa OPN protein which indicates that OPN is glycosylated [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref>@ ] .
PC3 @/@ OPN and PC3 @/@ RGA cells increase Akt activation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> ; lanes 2 and 3 ) when compared with PC3 cells , suggesting that OPN can induce activation of Akt in the absence of integrin signaling ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> , lane 1 ) .
In the presence of the αV inhibitor , PC3 @/@ OPN cells no longer have the ability to induce activation of Akt ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , lane 6 ) , while expression of mutant OPN in PC3 cells ( PC3 @/@ RGA ) did not affect the phosphorylation of Akt ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> , lane 5 ) .
The ability of PC3 @/@ RGA cells to activate Akt in the presence of the αV inhibitor suggests a role for an additional receptor .
CD44 is another receptor for OPN [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"> 13 </xref>@ ] and previous work from our laboratory showed that CD44 has an important role in the activation of MMP-9 and migration of PC3 cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , we sought to determine the role of CD44 in the activation of Akt using CD44 knock-down strategy with SiRNA to standard ( s ) CD44 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B-E </xref> ) .
We arrived at about 75 @-@ 85 % knockdown of sCD44 when using SiRNA to sCD44 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> , lane 2 ) .
Scrambled RNAi was used as a control ( lane 1 ) .
Mutation in OPN ( RGA ) abolishes Akt activation only in the cells depleted of CD44 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> , lane 5 ) while PC3 @/@ OPN cells retain the ability to induce Akt activation , presumably through the interaction of αVβ3 and OPN via RGD @-@ sequence ( lane 6 ) .
However , cells treated with SiRNA to CD44 and an inhibitor to αv demonstrated a considerable decrease of both CD44 and αVβ3 integrin @-@ mediated Akt activation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4E </xref> , lane 6 ) .
A graphical representation of changes in AKT phosphorylation ( i.e. activation ) is provided ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4E </xref> ) for the Western blot shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4D </xref>@ .
Cells treated with both αv @-@ inhibitor and SiRNA to CD44 was normalized to the corresponding control cells untreated with αv @-@ inhibitor but treated with scrambled RNAi ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4E </xref> ) .
These experiments illustrate that the interaction between OPN and either CD44 or integrin is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of Akt , which is largely responsible for the anti @-@ apoptotic mechanisms vital to cancer cell survival and progression .

Results
Inhibitors of Jak2 @/@ Stat3 , MEK @/@ Erk and PI3-K @/@ Akt pathways down-regulated IL-6 secretion in the lung adenocarcinoma PC14PE6 @/@ AS2 ( AS2 ) cells , which spontaneously secreted IL-6 and possessed constitutively activated Stat3 .
Transfection with dominant @-@ negative Stat3 , Stat3 siRNA , or Stat3 shRNA decreased IL-6 expression in AS2 cells .
Conversely , transfection with constitutively @-@ activated Stat3 increased the production of IL-6 .
In AS2 derived cells , resistance to paclitaxel was positively correlated with Stat3 activation status and the expression of IL-6 , which is commonly secreted in drug resistant cancer cells .
The pharmacological inhibition of NF @- ? B , PI3-K @/@ Akt and MEK @/@ Erk and the pharmacological inhibition and genetic inhibition ( Stat3 siRNA ) of Jak2 @/@ Stat3 pathway decreased IL-6 autocrine production in various drug resistant cancer cell lines and similarly decreased IL-6 autocrine production in clinically isolated lung cancer cells .

Autocrine IL-6 induced Stat3 activation and paclitaxel resistance in AS2 cells
We previously demonstrated that AS2 cells produced autocrine IL-6 and the secreted IL-6 induced Stat3 activation and subsequently promoted tumor progression [ 2 ] .
We used ELISA and Western blot analysis to measure IL-6 secretion and Stat3 activation ( phosphorylation ) after medium replacement to remove the existing IL-6 in the old medium and make it possible to measure the amount of newly secreted IL-6 time @-@ dependently in AS2 cells , respectively .
We found the constitutive secretion of IL-6 at hours 1 to 24 and the activation of Stat3 peaked at hours 3 and 8 , confirming the autocrine production of IL-6 and the subsequent activation of Stat3 in AS2 cells ( Figure 1A and 1B ) .
It has been shown that cancer cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agents express elevated levels of IL-6 , and the IL-6 contributes to the drug resistance of cancer cells [ 30,39 ] .
In our MTT assay of the effect of IL-6 on paclitaxel sensitivity in AS2 cells , we found a significant increase ( about 15 % ) in cell viability in cells pre @-@ treated with exogenous IL-6 and a significant decrease ( about 15 % ) in cell viability in cells treated with anti @-@ IL-6R , compared to the un @-@ pretreated cells ( both p < 0.001 ) , indicating that autocrine IL-6 contributed to the paclitaxel resistance in AS2 cells ( Figure 1C ) .
Jak2 @/@ Stat3 pathway positively regulated IL-6 autocrine production in AS2 cells
To investigate whether Jak2 @/@ Stat3 as well as the other three IL-6 downstream pathways ( PI3-K @/@ Akt , MEK @/@ Erk , and NF @- ? B ) known to be involved in IL-6 expression in various cells would act as an upstream regulator of IL-6 autocrine production in AS2 cells , we used ELISA to measure IL-6 secretion in one control AS2 group and in four different AS2 treatment groups each with one pathway ( Jak2 @/@ Stat3 , PI3-K @/@ Akt , MEK @/@ Erk , or NF @- ? B ) pharmacologically inhibited by the inhibitors AG490 , LY294002 , U0126 , or BAY11 @-@ 7082 , respectively .
We found that , compared to the controls , MEK @/@ Erk inhibitor and PI3-K @/@ Akt inhibitor reduced IL-6 secretion in AS2 cells by about 80 % and 90 % ( both p < 0.01 ) , but NF @- ? B inhibitor decreased it by only 20 % ( p < 0.05 ) ( Figure 2A ) .
Importantly , Jak2 @/@ Stat3 inhibitor also reduced IL-6 secretion by more than 60 % ( p < 0.01 ) .
Though Jak2 @/@ Stat3 inhibitor was not the most efficient , Jak2 @/@ Stat3 pathway clearly participates in the regulation of IL-6 and should be significant an upstream regulator of IL-6 secretion in AS2 cells ( Figure 2A ) .
To exclude the possibility that the reduction of IL-6 secretion was mainly caused by the reduction of cell survival , cell viability was measured by MTT assay after being treated with each one of four inhibitors .
None of these inhibitors compromised the viability of AS2 cells during the treatment period at the indicated doses ( Additional file 1 , Figure S1A ) .
To confirm our findings , we performed inhibition experiments on AS2 cells using increasing doses of Jak2 @/@ Stat3 inhibitor .
Decrease in Stat3 phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blot analysis , and IL-6 secretion was measured by ELISA .
We found the Jak2 @/@ Stat3 inhibitor dose @-@ dependently decreased Stat3 phosphorylation ( Figure 2B ) and IL-6 secretion ( p < 0.05 at doses higher than 20 “ M ) ( Figure 2C ) .
We also used MTT assay to analyze the effect of the increasing doses of AG490 on cell viability and showed that only a minor reduction in cell survival ( about 15 % ) was found when cells exposed to 80 “ M AG490 ( Additional file 1 , Figure S1B ) .
In addition , we showed that treatment with AG490 ( 40 “ M ) significantly decreased IL-6 promoter activity ( Figure 2D ) .
Our results suggest that Jak2 @/@ Stat3 pathway may regulate the autocrine production of IL-6 in AS2 cells .
Stat3 activation status was positively correlated with IL-6 expression and paclitaxel resistance in AS2 @-@ derived cells
To clarify the role of Stat3 on IL-6 autocrine production proposed by the biochemical studies , we performed genetic studies to investigate the effect of varying degrees of Stat3 activation and inactivation on the mRNA expression and the secretion of IL-6 using parental AS2 cells and various previously established AS2 @-@ derived cell lines with different Stat3 activation status : vector control cells , two AS2 @/@ S3C cells , two AS2 @/@ S3D cells , and two AS2 @/@ S3F cells [ 2,10 ] .
In this current study , we used S3C as active form Stat3 , and S3D and S3F as inactivated forms of Stat3 .
Western blot analysis showed increased expression of Stat3 protein in all mutant cells , in the AS2 @/@ S3C cells ( AS2 @/@ S3C-A and AS2 @/@ S3C-C ) , in the AS2 @/@ S3D cells ( AS2 @/@ S3D-8 and AS2 @/@ S3D-9 ) and in the AS2 @/@ S3F cells ( AS2 @/@ S3F-3 and AS2 @/@ S3F-7 ) , compared to the parental cells ( AS2 ) and vector control cells ( AS2 @/@ Vec-11 ) ( Figure 3A ) .
However , only AS2 @/@ S3F cells but not AS2 @/@ S3C or AS2 @/@ S3D cells were found to have decreases in Stat3 phosphorylation ( Figure 3A ) .
RT-PCR showed that the AS2 @/@ S3C cells expressed 3 to 4 times more IL-6 mRNA than the parental and vector control cells and that AS2 @/@ S3D and AS2 @/@ S3F cells expressed 30 to 70 percent less IL-6 mRNA ( Figure 3B ) .
Similarly , transient transfection with S3C plasmid increased IL-6 promoter luciferase activity by more than 70 % and transient transfection with S3F plasmid decreased IL-6 promoter luciferase activity by more than 40 % compared with the mock and vector control groups ( both p < 0.001 ) ( Figure 3C ) .
ELISA showed that AS2 @/@ S3C cells secreted 5 to 10 times more IL-6 than the parental and vector control cells ( both p < 0.001 ) ( Figure 3D ) and AS2 @/@ S3D and AS2 @/@ S3F cells secreted 40 to 80 percent less IL-6 ( both p < 0.01 in AS2 @/@ S3D cells and both p < 0.001 in S3F cells ) ( Figure 3E ) .
These results show that Stat3 may positively regulate the expression of IL-6 mRNA expression and the secretion of IL-6 in AS2 cells .
To evaluate drug resistance , we treated the parental AS2 cells , vector control cells ( AS2 @/@ Vec-11 ) , the AS2 @/@ S3C cells ( AS2 @/@ S3C-C ) , the AS2 @/@ S3D cells ( AS2 @/@ S3D-9 ) , and the AS2 @/@ S3F cells ( AS2 @/@ S3F-3 ) with paclitaxel for 72 hours .
Using MTT assay to access cell viability , we found AS2 cells with increased Stat3 activity ( AS2 @/@ S3C-C ) to be more resistant to paclitaxel than AS2 and AS2 @/@ Vec-11 cells ( p < 0.05 ) , and AS2 cells with decreased Stat3 activity ( AS2 @/@ S3D-9 and AS2 @/@ S3F-3 ) to be less resistant to paclitaxel ( p < 0.05 ) ( Figure 3F ) .
Together , these findings suggest that the activation of Stat3 may contribute to the regulation of IL-6 autocrine production and resistance to paclitaxel in AS2 cells .
Knocking @-@ down Stat3 by transient transfection with synthetic siRNA decreased IL-6 expression in AS2 cells
To confirm that Stat3 regulated IL-6 expression in cancer cells , we transiently transfected AS2 cells with Stat3 siRNA to knock-down the expression of Stat3 .
Western blot analysis showed transfection with Stat3 siRNA ( Stat3#1 ) dose @-@ dependently decreased the total amount of Stat3 protein and phosphorylated Stat3 ( Figure 4A ) .
RT-PCR and ELISA showed transfection with Stat3#1 reduced the expression of IL-6 mRNA ( Figure 4B ) and the secretion of IL-6 at 3 , 8 , and 24 hours after medium replacement ( p < 0.01 in the lower dose and p < 0.001 in the higher doses ) ( Figure 4C ) .
To make sure our results were not confounded by differences in cell viability , we performed MTT assay of the transfected and untransfected cells , and found that these siRNAs did not affect the viability of AS2 cells ( Figure 4D ) .
The findings suggested that the suppression of IL-6 production by knocking @-@ down Stat3 was not likely a result of a decrease in cell number .
As can be seen in Figures S2A and S2B in Additional file 2 , the other Stat3 siRNA ( Stat3#2 ) with a different targeting sequence also knocked @-@ down Stat3 expression and reduced IL-6 secretion but did not compromise cell proliferation ( Additional file 3 , Figure S3A ) , a further confirmation of our findings .
Knocking @-@ down Stat3 by stable transfection with shRNA decreased the expression of IL-6 in AS2 cells
To further investigate the possible role of Stat3 in the regulation of IL-6 , we stably transfected AS2 cells with the control vector from which we selected one cell line ( AS2 @/@ shVec ) and the vector expressing Stat3 shRNA from which we selected two cell lines ( AS2 @/@ shStat3 @-@ 1 and AS2 @/@ shStat3 @-@ 2 ) .
Western blot analysis showed a lower expression of Stat3 protein and a lower level of Stat3 phosphorylation in both cell lines expressing Stat3 shRNA than in either the parental cells or the vector control cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> ) .
RT-PCR showed a continuing decrease in the expression of IL-6 mRNA in both cell lines expressing Stat3 shRNA ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5B </xref> ) .
ELISA also showed a continuing decrease IL-6 secretion in both cell lines expressing Stat3 shRNA compared to the parental AS2 ( 90 % in AS2 @/@ shStat3 @-@ 1 and 95 % AS2 @/@ shStat3 @-@ 2 at 24 hours ) ( p < 0.001 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5C </xref> ) .
We also analyzed the drug resistance of these cells to paclitaxel by MTT assay .
MTT assay showed that the permanent knock-down of Stat3 in AS2 @/@ shStat3 @-@ 1 and AS2 @/@ shStat3 @-@ 2 cells significantly reduced their resistance to paclitaxel ( p < 0.001 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5D </xref> ) .
Pretreatment with exogenous IL-6 modestly restored the resistance ( p < 0.01 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5D </xref> ) .
These data suggest that the IL-6 @-@ induced paclitaxel resistance is mediated by both Stat3 @-@ dependent and Stat3 @-@ independent pathways .
<sec-title level="2"> Stat3 contributed to the elevation of IL-6 in drug resistant cancer cells </sec-title>
It has been shown that cancer cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agents express elevated levels of IL-6 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"> 39 </xref>@ ] .
Thus , drug resistant cancer cells are ideal models for studying IL-6 autocrine production .
To find out whether IL-6 would be regulated by Stat3 in cancer cell lines other than AS2 , we performed genetic siRNA experiments on two drug resistant cancer cell lines ( KB @-@ CPT100 and MCF-7 @/@ ADR ) .
MTT assay revealed that KB @-@ CPT100 cells were more resistant to the chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin than the parental KB cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6A </xref> ) and MCF-7 @/@ ADR cells were much more resistant to the chemotherapeutic agent epirubicin than the parental MCF-7 cells ( p < 0.001 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6B </xref> ) .
The two drug resistant cell lines were found by ELISA to secrete more IL-6 than their parental cells ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6C </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6D </xref> ) .
We transiently transfected the two drug resistant cells with Stat3#1 to knock-down Stat3 .
Western blot analysis confirmed that the total amount of Stat3 protein and phosphorylated Stat3 had been knocked @-@ down in both resistant cells ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6E </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6F </xref> ) .
MTT assay found no change in cell viability ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> , Figure S3B and S3C ) .
ELISA revealed that knocking @-@ down Stat3 decreased the secretion of IL-6 in KB @-@ CPT100 cells by one @-@ third ( p < 0.001 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6G </xref> ) and by one @-@ half in MCF-7 @/@ ADR cells ( p < 0.001 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6H </xref> ) .
These results suggest that the Stat3 also contributes to the elevation of IL-6 in drug resistant cancer cells .
<sec-title level="2"> Jak2 @/@ Stat3 pathway regulated the expression of IL-6 in cooperation with other IL-6 downstream pathways </sec-title>
To find out whether IL-6 could be regulated by different combinations of its downstream pathways including Jak2 @/@ Stat3 in various cancer cells , we pharmacologically inhibited the four IL-6 downstream pathways in six drug resistant cancer cell lines derived from cervical cancer , breast cancer , and lung cancer cells .
ELISA revealed that all drug resistant cells secreted more IL-6 than their parental cells .
Different cells used different combinations of signaling pathways , including Jak2 @/@ Stat3 , to regulate secretion of IL-6 ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7A </xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7F </xref> ) .
To exclude the possibility that the reduction of IL-6 secretion was caused by the reduction of cell survival , we used MTT assay to analyze the effect of these inhibitors on cell viability ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> , Figure S1C to S1H ) .
We showed that the majority of inhibitors had only limited suppressive effect on cell viability ( below 25 % ) ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> , Figure S1C @-@ S1H ) except that the PI3-K @/@ Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 had more suppressive activity on the cellular viability by 30 to 50 % ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> , Figure S1C @-@ S1F ) .
However , LY294002 induced much greater ( 75 to 90 % ) decrease of IL-6 in these cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7A </xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7D </xref> ) .
There is only one exception that the AG490 @-@ induced reductions of cell survival and IL-6 secretion were both about 30 % in KB-7D cells ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> , Figure S1F and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7D </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Jak2 @/@ Stat3 pathway contributed to IL-6 autocrine production in clinically isolated lung cancer cells </sec-title>
Because previous studies suggesting Stat3 on IL-6 were all <i> in vitro </i> cell line studies , not clinical studies , we also wanted to find out whether IL-6 could be regulated by different combinations of pathways including Jak2 @/@ Stat3 in not just cell lines but also in the human body .
We had previously found IL-6 levels to be increased in MPE of patients with lung cancer [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref>@ ] .
To do this , we pharmacologically inhibited the four IL-6 downstream pathways in 20 clinical samples of human lung cancer obtained from MPE .
ELISA revealed that IL-6 was expressed in the conditioned medium of all samples , ranging from 16.58 ± 0.21 to 1016.47 ± 12.45 pg @/@ ml ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8A </xref> ) , with a mean of 393.14 pg @/@ ml .
The four aforementioned inhibitors significantly decreased IL-6 secretion in the clinically isolated cancer cells differently ( U0126 , p < 0.01 ; AG490 , LY294002 and BAY11 @-@ 7082 , all p < 0.001 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8A </xref> ) .
We further analyzed the percent of inhibition by each inhibitor on IL-6 secretion .
BAY11 @-@ 7082 had the greatest inhibitory activity on the autocrine production of IL-6 in the clinical samples ( BAY11 @-@ 7082 > LY294002 > AG490 > U0126 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8"> 8B </xref> ) .

<sec-title level="2"> Patient cohort characteristics </sec-title>
The clinical data collected and recorded for each patient included age ( median : 70 years ; inter @-@ quartile range : 66 @–@ 74 years ) , PSA level at diagnosis ( median : 31 ng ml @<sup> −1 </sup> ; inter @-@ quartile range : 7.8 @–@ 109 ng ml @<sup> −1 </sup> ) , PSA level at relapse ( median : 10 ng ml @<sup> −1 </sup> ; inter @-@ quartile range : 4 @–@ 11 ng ml @<sup> −1 </sup> ) and Gleason grade at diagnosis ( median : 8 , inter @-@ quartile range : 7 @–@ 9 ) .
All patients underwent biochemical relapse ( median time to relapse : 2.54 years ; inter @-@ quartile range : 1.51 @–@ 4.62 years ) .
All patients included in this study were deceased ( median time to death after relapse : 1.37 years ; inter @-@ quartile range : 0.82 @–@ 2.69 ) .
This resulted in an overall median survival time of 4.5 years ( inter @-@ quartile range : 3.00 @–@ 7.01 ) .
Patients were diagnosed with locally advanced ( 46 patients ) or metastatic ( 19 patients ) prostate cancer , and at the time of relapse the number of patients presenting with metastatic disease had risen ( 40 patients ) .
At diagnosis , patients either underwent surgery ( 27 orchidectomy ) or androgen deprivation therapy ( 59 GnRH analogue and @/@ or anti @-@ androgen deprivation therapy ) .
Most patients were deceased during the course of follow @-@ up ( 46 patients ) , although some survived beyond follow @-@ up ( 19 patients ) .
The presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis was associated with reduced time to biochemical relapse ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.037 ) and a trend in overall patient survival ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.06 ) .
High Gleason scores were associated with more rapid biochemical relapse ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.002 ) , time to death after biochemical relapse ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.02 ) and disease @-@ specific survival ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.001 ) , confirming the association of these clinical parameters with the progression of prostate cancer .
<sec-title level="2"> Expression and localisation of Raf-1 and MAPK </sec-title>
Raf-1 was observed in the cytoplasm and peri @-@ membrane areas ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1A </xref> ) , and the inactive form of Raf-1 was found only in the peri @-@ membrane region ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1B </xref> ) ; however , the activated form of Raf-1 was observed in the cytoplasm , nucleus and the cell membrane ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1C </xref> ) .
Mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase and phosphorylated MAPK ( pMAPK ) ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) were observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1D </xref> ) .
Overall , comparison of HNPC tumours and CRPC tumours revealed no differences in total or average expression levels of either Raf-1 ( and all phosphorylated forms ) ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ) or MAPK ( activated or inactivate , nuclear or cytoplasmic ) ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"> Table 2 </xref> ) .
However , analysis of matched pairs revealed a subgroup that showed significant increases in Raf-1 and MAPK levels in CRPC tumours .
We have previously reported that patients whose Raf-1 expression rose in this cohort with the development of CRPC had a significantly shorter time to relapse than those patients who had a fall or no change ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0005 ) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"> Mukherjee <i> et al </i> , 2005 </xref> ) .
Consistent with this observation , patients with rising levels of nuclear pRaf ( Ser338 , activated Raf-1 ) had a significantly shorter time to biochemical relapse ( 2.2 years ; range : 1.84 @–@ 2.56 years ) by 2.4 years when compared with patients who showed a fall in levels ( 4.6 years ; range : 3.4 @–@ 5.8 years ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.01 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref> ) .
Patients whose nuclear MAPK expression rose with the development of CRPC had a significantly shorter time to death from relapse ( 1.40 ( 1.20 @–@ 1.61 ) years ) compared with samples that showed a fall or no change in expression ( 3.00 ( 1.43 @–@ 4.57 ) years ) , <i> P </i>@ = 0.0255 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3A </xref> ) .
This translated into a shorter disease @-@ specific survival of 3.37 ( 1.58 @–@ 5.16 ) years compared with 6.89 ( 5.70 @–@ 8.08 ) years , <i> P </i>@ = 0.0068 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3B </xref> ) .
Interestingly , there was also an association seen between rising cytoplasmic pMAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) expression and reduced time to biochemical relapse ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.06 ) .

In HNPC tumours , Raf-1 correlated with the inactive form , pRaf ( Ser259 ) , before relapse ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0041 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1201 ) .
Nuclear pRaf ( Ser338 ) and cytoplasmic pRaf ( Ser338 ) strongly correlated with each other ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0035 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1381 ) .
No correlations between total Raf-1 and cytoplasmic pRaf ( Ser338 ) or nuclear pRaf ( Ser338 ) expression were evident .
In addition no correlations were observed between the inactive form of pRaf ( Ser259 ) and nuclear pRaf ( Ser338 ) or cytoplasmic pRaf ( Ser338 ) .
Total cytoplasmic expression of MAPK correlated with total nuclear expression of MAPK ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0126 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1009 ) , activated MAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0152 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1044 ) and the cytoplasmic expression of MAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.3391 ) .
Total nuclear MAPK expression correlated very strongly with the activated form of MAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) in the nucleus ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.3447 ) and pMAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) in the cytoplasm ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0075 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1250 ) .
Activated cytoplasmic MAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) also very strongly associated with its activated expression ( MAPK pThr202 ) in the nucleus ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.5210 ) .
In addition , Raf-1 and pRaf ( Ser259 ) both correlated with the cytoplasmic expression of MAPK ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2979 and <i> P </i>@ = 0.0005 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1879 , respectively ) and activated cytoplasmic MAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0007 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1826 and <i> P </i>@ = 0.0069 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1214 , respectively ) .
Raf-1 also correlated with nuclear activated MAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0022 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1525 ) .

In CRPC tumours , Raf-1 correlated with pRaf ( Ser259 ) strongly ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0003 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1778 ) .
The nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of pRaf ( Ser338 ) also strongly correlated with each other ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.6009 ) .
Similarly to HNPC , protein expression of the inactive form of pRaf ( Ser259 ) and the active forms of pRaf ( Ser338 ) did not correlate in the cell cytoplasm or nucleus .
After the development of CRPC , cytoplasmic expression of total MAPK became strongly associated with the expression of total MAPK in the nucleus ( <i> P </i>@ = < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2564 ) and more weakly with its activated form , pMAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) , in the nucleus ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0194 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.0864 ) .
Cytoplasmic expression of total MAPK continued to show a correlation with its activated form in the cytoplasm ( MAPK pThr202 @/@ pThr204 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0004 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1861 ) .
Activated cytoplasmic MAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) remained strongly associated with activated nuclear MAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.5350 ) .
Raf-1 showed similar associations with cytoplasmic and nuclear MAPK expression ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2141 and <i> P </i>@ = 0.0016 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1426 , respectively ) .
Cytoplasmic MAPK also correlated with pRaf ( Ser259 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0026 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1329 ) .
Similarly to HNPC tumours , no correlations were noted between pRaf ( Ser338 ) and MAPK in any location or form .
<sec-title level="2"> Relative expression levels of Raf-1 and MAPK compared with upstream and downstream targets in hormone @-@ naïve prostate cancer </sec-title>
Analysis of the upstream activators EGFR and Her2 , as well as the downstream targets AR and AP-1 , has previously been carried out on the same cohort of patients ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"> Edwards <i> et al </i> , 2003a </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"> 2004 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"> Bartlett <i> et al </i> , 2005 </xref> ) .
We therefore correlated Raf-1 and MAPK expression with these previous results , to determine the differences in the entire pathway in the transition from HNPC to CRPC .
In hormone @-@ naïve tumours , expression of the putative growth factor receptor Her2 correlated with Raf-1 expression ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0099 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1333 ) and the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of pMAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0150 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1300 and <i> P </i>@ = 0.0017 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2074 , respectively ) .
Once activated , the phosphorylated form of Her2 ( pHer2 ) showed moderate correlations with Raf-1 ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0056 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1435 ) , pRaf ( Ser259 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0052 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1459 ) and cytoplasmic MAPK expression ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0123 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1211 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref> ) , but not the activated forms of Raf or MAPK .
No correlations were seen with EGFR in HNPC tumours , except weak correlations with Raf-1 ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0439 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.06008 ) and pMAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( nuclear ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0243 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.0844 ) .
However , the mutant variant , EGFR vIII , did correlate strongly with cytoplasmic expression of MAPK ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2617 ) and to a weaker extent with Raf-1 ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.025 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.07965 ) and pRaf ( Ser259 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0323 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.07295 ) .
Further downstream , activated pRaf ( Ser338 ) in the cytoplasm strongly correlated with phosphorylated c-jun ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0009 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2673 ) and total MAPK ( cytoplasmic ) correlated weakly with c-Fos ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0453 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.09418 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref> ) .
There were no correlations seen between MAPK and its activated form with c-jun , phospho c-Jun or c-Fos .
In addition , PSA showed weak correlations with Raf-1 ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0142 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.09604 ) , pRaf ( Ser259 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.043 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.06547 ) , and showed links to overall MAPK levels , MAPK ( nuclear ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0029 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1502 ) and MAPK ( cytoplasmic ) ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2467 ) , with strong ties to the activated forms , pMAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( cytoplasmic ) ( <i> P </i> < 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2891 ) and pMAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) ( nuclear ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0001 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2233 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6 </xref> ) , whereas AR showed no correlations with Raf , MAPK or any of their forms .
<sec-title level="2"> Relative expression levels of Raf-1 and MAPK compared with upstream and downstream targets in CRPC </sec-title>
After the development of CRPC , Her2 no longer showed a correlation with Raf-1 nor a negative association became evident between pRaf ( Ser338 ) both in the cytoplasm ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0035 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1854 ) and nucleus ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0068 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1581 ) with Her2 .
In addition , the activated form ( pHer2 ) correlated with pRaf ( Ser259 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0008 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2011 ) .
Interestingly , the activated cytoplasmic form of Raf showed a positive weak correlation with the pHer2 ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0363 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.09376 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref> ) .
Furthermore , no correlations were evident between Her2 or pHer2 with MAPK in any form .
All associations between EGFR and EGFR vIII disappeared after progression to CRPC .
A moderate positive correlation was seen between pRaf ( Ser259 ) and AR ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0035 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1154 ) , whereas a negative correlation is evident between nuclear MAPK and AR ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0429 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.06066 ) .
There was no correlation ( positive or negative ) shown between total Raf-1 expression and AR .
In addition , there were no correlations noted between either Raf-1 ( any form ) or MAPK ( any form ) and PSA level .
More correlations were noted with components of the downstream transcription factor AP-1 .
Correlations were evident between phosphorylated c-jun and cytoplasmic pRaf ( Ser338 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0026 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.2192 ) and pRaf ( Ser259 ) ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0278 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1077 ) .
There was also a correlation seen between Raf-1 and c-Fos ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0131 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1512 ) , and between the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of pMAPK ( Thr202 @/@ Thr204 ) and c-jun ( <i> P </i>@ = 0.0146 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1368 and <i> P </i>@ = 0.0178 , <i> r </i> <sup> 2 </sup>@ = 0.1295 , respectively ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> Figure 8 </xref> ) .

Expression of RKIP , p-MEK , and p-ERK was found in 69 ( 66 % ) , 54 ( 51 % ) , and 64 ( 61 % ) of all tumours , respectively .
RKIP expression negatively correlated with the depth of invasion ( p < 0.001 ) , lymph node involvement ( p = 0.028 ) , and Union for International Cancer Control ( UICC ) stage ( p = 0.007 ) .
RKIP expression was associated with significantly longer relapse @-@ free survival ( RFS ) ( p = 0.0033 ) , whereas p-MEK was not ( p = 0.79 ) .

Patients with positive p-ERK and negative RKIP expression had significantly shorter RFS than the other patients ( p < 0.001 ) .
The combination of RKIP and p-ERK expression was an independent prognostic factor ( hazard ratio , 2.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.3 - 4.6 ; p = 0.008 ) .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
RKIP , p-MEK , and p-ERK were respectively expressed by 69 ( 66 % ) , 54 ( 51 % ) , and 64 ( 61 % ) of all tumours ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1a-c </xref> ) .
RKIP expression was mainly observed in the cytoplasm of tumour or non @-@ tumour cells .
Expressions of p-MEK and p-ERK were found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus .
Expressions of RKIP , p-MEK , and p-ERK were respectively detected in 5 ( 19 % ) , 9 ( 35 % ) , and 21 ( 81 % ) of 26 metastatic lymph nodes obtained from patients with recurrent disease ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1d-f </xref> ) .
Expression of p-ERK was found mainly in the nuclei of metastatic tumour cells .
These proteins were also detected in tumour cells associated with venous invasion ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1g-i </xref> ) .
No p-ERK or p-MEK staining was detected in normal gastric mucosa .
The expression of p-MEK positively correlated with the expressions of RKIP ( p = 0.042 ) and p-ERK ( p = 0.007 ) , whereas there was no relation between RKIP and p-ERK expressions ( p = 0.98 ) ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
RKIP expression negatively correlated with the depth of invasion ( p < 0.001 ) , lymph node involvement ( p = 0.028 ) , and UICC stage ( p = 0.007 ) .
RKIP was more commonly found in differentiated type than in undifferentiated type tumours ( p = 0.042 ) .
The expressions of p-ERK and p-MEK significantly correlated with gender ( p = 0.027 , p = 0.036 , respectively ) , but were not related to any other clinicopathological factor ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> ) .
RKIP expression was associated with significantly longer RFS ( p = 0.003 ) , whereas p-MEK was not ( p = 0.79 ) .
The presence of p-ERK expression was associated with slightly , but not significantly shorter RFS than the absence of such expression ( p = 0.054 ) ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3"> 3 </xref> ) .
Patients with positive p-ERK and negative RKIP expression had significantly shorter RFS than the other patients ( p < 0.001 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) .
The prognostic relevance of positive p-ERK expression combined with negative RKIP expression was therefore assessed using a multivariate proportional @-@ hazards model adjusted for established clinical prognostic factors ( i.e. , age , gender , histopathology , depth of invasion , lymph node involvement ) .
The combination of RKIP and p-ERK expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 2.4 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.3 - 4.6 ; p = 0.008 ) .
Histopathological type and depth of invasion were also independent prognostic factors ( HR , 2.1 ; 95 % CI , 1.0 - 4.2 ; p = 0.043 and HR , 4.7 ; 95 % CI , 1.0 @-@ 22 ; p = 0.048 , respectively ) ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3"> 3 </xref> ) .
Comparison of growth factor signalling pathway utilisation in cultured normal melanocytes and melanoma cell lines ( PMID : 22475322 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
Normal melanocytes could not be distinguished from melanoma cells on the basis of pathway utilisation when grown in the presence of serum , but could be distinguished upon serum starvation , where signalling protein phosphorylation was generally abrogated .
Surprisingly , the differential utilisation of individual pathways was not consistently associated with the presence of an oncogenic or tumour suppressor mutation of genes in these pathways .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> NZM cell line mutations in the PI3K and MAPK pathways </sec-title>
In order to determine whether the presence of activating mutations in the PI3K and MAPK signalling pathways correlated with increased utilisation of downstream signalling pathways , we first determined the mutational status of <i> PIK3CA , PTEN , NRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> genes in the NZM cell line collection .
Representative DNA sequences for <i> PTEN , PIK3CA , BRAF </i> and <i> NRAS </i> are provided in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ .
As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> , we selected cell lines that were characterised by a number of genetic mutations .
All of the selected cell lines harboured either oncogenic V600E or V600K <i> BRAF </i> or Q61H <i> NRAS </i> mutations .
Since the tumour suppressor gene <i> PTEN </i> can be functionally lost during melanoma development through both mutation and epigenetic mechanisms [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"> 32 </xref>@ ] , we measured PTEN protein expression in the NZM cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) .
Mutation of the <i> PTEN </i> gene led to loss of functional PTEN protein expression , as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ .
The cell lines NZM40 , NZM46 and NZM52 , which all harbour the oncogenic H1047R <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation , had concurrent <i> BRAF </i> or <i> NRAS </i> mutations ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Of particular interest was the high degree of expression of PTEN protein in the NZM46 cell line , compared to other cell lines harbouring the <i> PIK3CA </i> oncogenic mutation .
Since the presence of an oncogenic mutation or a loss of tumour suppressor function does not dictate whether the cell uses all of the downstream signalling molecules for pathway activation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"> 33 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref>@ ] , we determined the phosphorylation status of the immediate downstream substrates of the PI3K , mTOR and MAPK pathways .
Western blots for phosphorylated molecules were used as surrogate markers for pathway activation .
<sec-title level="2"> Phosphorylation of PKB in melanoma and melanocytes </sec-title>
In order to establish whether <i> PIK3CA , PTEN , NRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> mutations resulted in constitutive activation of the downstream signalling pathways , we measured PKB activation by western blotting for phosphorylation at two sites , Ser473 and Thr308 .
Equal amounts of protein from NZM cell lines were loaded onto the same gel , but for clarity , western blots were segmented to show results for individual NZM cell lines .
In melanocytes , phosphorylation of PKB on both Ser473 and Thr308 was strongly serum dependent while most of the NZM cell lines in this study showed serum independent phosphorylation .
PKB was phosphorylated independently of serum at the mTORC2 dependent Ser473 site in most of the cell lines , although NZM46 and NZM3 surprisingly had very low levels of phosphorylation even in the presence of serum ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) .
In contrast , phosphorylation at the PIP @<sub> 3 </sub>@ -@ PDK1 dependent Thr308 site tended to be low in the serum starved state in most cell lines and increased with serum ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) .
The notable exceptions were cell lines NZM12 , NZM40 and NZM52 which have comparatively high Thr308 phosphorylation in serum starved cells .
Phosphorylation of Thr308 in the NZM40 and NZM52 cell lines may be explained by the activating <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation in these cells .
These two cell lines also have a very low level of total PKB suggesting some feedback regulation of PKB gene expression in these cells .
In support of this , NZM46 , which also has a <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) , also has very high PTEN levels ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) which could explain the low Thr308 phosphorylation in these cells and the higher levels of total PKB compared to NZM40 and NZM52 , as PIP @<sub> 3 </sub> levels would be predicted to be low despite the <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation .
NZM46 shows suppression of phosphorylation by serum in the Thr308 site ( as with the Ser473 site ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Phosphorylation of components of the mTOR pathway in melanoma cells and melanocytes </sec-title>
Activation of components of the protein translation machinery has been observed in a large percentage of melanomas and is predictive of a poor prognosis [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"> 35 </xref>@ ] .
The PI3K signalling pathway can regulate protein translation machinery through mTORC1 and subsequent activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 ( rpS6 ) .
Therefore we next determined the phosphorylation status of p70S6K ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref> ) .
The p70S6K was strongly expressed in all cell lines as well as in normal melanocytes but the pattern of phosphorylation of p70S6K and p85S6K at Thr389 did not correlate with the phosphorylation status of PKB nor did it correlate with genotypes ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref> ) .
In melanocytes , the observed phosphorylation of Ser235 @/@ Ser236 was serum dependent while Ser240 @/@ Ser244 site , which is phosphorylated by p70S6K , was phosphorylated even in the absence of serum .
In most of the cell lines , we observed serum independent phosphorylation of rpS6 while in NZM43 and to some degree , NZM10 and NZM15 showed serum dependent phosphorylation .
Interestingly , we observed little phosphorylation of rpS6 at both sites in <i> BRAF </i> mutant cell lines , NZM3 and NZM12 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) .
Thus , phosphorylation of rpS6 is independent of PI3K pathway activation in these melanoma cell lines .
In these cells the phosphorylation of rpS6 is likely due to input from the ERK signalling cascade as can be seen in other cell types [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"> 36 </xref>@ ] .
<sec-title level="2"> Phosphorylation of components of the ERK pathway in melanoma cells and melanocytes </sec-title>
We also analysed the activation status of the MAPK pathway in NZM cell lines with <i> NRAS </i> or <i> BRAF </i> mutations and cell lines which additionally harbour <i> PTEN </i> or <i> PIK3CA </i> mutations .
The activation of MEK and then ERK in response to oncogenic <i> NRAS </i> and <i> BRAF </i> mutations is proposed to be the basis of a MAPK pathway addiction by these cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref>@ ] .
Total MEK protein was abundantly expressed in all NZM cell lines as well as melanocytes ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
However levels of MEK phosphorylation varied considerably and were not directly related to genotype ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
Furthermore , <i> NRAS @- </i>@ only mutant NZM cell lines , NZM10 , NZM15 and NZM42 showed very low levels of MEK phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
ERK was constitutively phosphorylated in almost all cell lines , and unlike melanocytes , NZM cell lines showed serum independent MEK and ERK phosphorylation patterns ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7"> 7 </xref> ) .
Furthermore , MEK phosphorylation status did not correlate with ERK phosphorylation patterns .
The JAK inhibitor AZD1480 regulates proliferation and immunity in Hodgkin lymphoma ( PMID : 22829094 )
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Expression of activated JAK2 in cultured HL cells </sec-title>
To explore the potential therapeutic value of the JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480 in HL , we initially examined the expression pattern of its protein target , the active , phosphorylated form of JAK2 Y1007 @/@ Y1008 , in cultured HL cells .
We hypothesized that cells with high levels of p-JAK2 would be more sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of AZD1480 than cells with lower levels of p-JAK2 .
We found p-JAK2 to be expressed in two of the four HL cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1a </xref> ) .
None of the HL cell lines expressed p-JAK1 Y1022 @/@ Y1023 , two cell lines expressed p-TYK2 Y1054 @/@ Y1055 , and only one cell line ( L-540 ) expressed p-JAK3 Y980 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1a </xref> ) .
Thus , the activation pattern of the JAK family members is rather heterogeneous in the HL cell lines .
Next , we investigated the expression pattern of the active phosphorylated form of downstream ( p-STATs ) .
We found p-STAT3 , p-STAT5 and p-STAT6 to be expressed in the three cell lines that expressed at least one active phosphorylated member of the JAK family : HD-LM2 , L-428 and L-540 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1a </xref> ) .
Consistent with a previous report , the KM-H2 cell line did not express p-JAKs or p-STAT3 , pSTAT5 or pSTAT6 proteins ; <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"> 19 </xref> </sup> neither did the three samples of PBMCs isolated from healthy donors .
We found p-STAT1 to be expressed in all HL cell lines and in only one PBMC sample from a healthy donor .
<sec-title level="2"> AZD1480 inhibits STAT3 , STAT5 and STAT6 phosphorylation in HL cells </sec-title>
The differential expression of JAK @/@ STAT family members in HL cell lines gave us an opportunity to determine the biological effect of AZD1480 in cells that have thee different patterns of expression : HD-LM2 and L-428 ( which expressed p-JAK2 and p-TYK2 ) , L-540 ( which expressed p-JAK3 ) , and KM-H2 ( which lacked p-JAKs expression ) .
Increasing concentrations of AZD1480 ( 0.1 @–@ 5 μ ) inhibited STAT1 , STAT3 , STAT5 and STAT6 phosphorylation in all three cell lines that showed evidence of full JAK @/@ STAT activation : HD-LM2 , L-428 and L-540 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1b </xref> ) .
These results suggest that in addition to JAK2 , AZD1480 may also inhibit JAK3 activity in HL cell lines .
Potent inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation was observed as soon as after 30 min of incubation with AZD1480 and was maintained up to 72 h ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure S1A and B </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Antiproliferative effects of AZD1480 in HL cell lines </sec-title>
Previous studies have demonstrated that HL cell lines are addicted to the JAK @/@ STAT pathway , and selective inhibition of STAT proteins by RNA interference has been shown to result in antiproliferative effects in HL cell lines . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"> 2 </xref> </sup>
Because AZD1480 inhibited p-STAT3 , p-STAT5 and p-STAT6 , we investigated the antiproliferative effect of AZD1480 in HL cells by using the MTS assay .
AZD1480 induced antiproliferative effects in a time @- and dose @-@ dependent manner ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1c </xref> ) .
After 72 h of incubation , the half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> ) values for AZD1480 ranged from 1 to 8 μ ; L-540 cells were the most sensitive to AZD1480 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1c and d </xref> ) .
Thus , although submicromolar concentrations of AZD1480 inhibited STAT phosphorylation , these low concentrations were not sufficient to induce a significant antiproliferative activity , especially in the HD-LM2 and L-428 cells .
In contrast , at a higher concentration ( 5 μ ) , AZD1480 had a stronger effect in all cell lines , including KM-H2 , which lacked active JAK @/@ STAT proteins .
These data suggest that at this higher concentration ( 5 μ ) , AZD1480 induced antiproliferative effects in HL cell lines in a JAK @/@ STAT @-@ independent manner .
To further investigate the mechanisms of the antiproliferative activity of AZD1480 , we determined the inhibitor 's effect on apoptosis .
Consistent with the MTS data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1c </xref> , we found that AZD1480 induced apoptotic cell death in a dose @-@ dependent manner ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2a and b </xref> ) .
At the lower concentration of AZD1480 ( 1 μ ) , L-540 cells were the most sensitive ( 43.3 % cell death after 72 h of incubation ) and L-428 cells were modestly sensitive ( 27.6 % cell death ) .
At the higher concentration ( 5 μ ) , AZD1480 induced apoptosis in all four cell lines , but L-540 cells remained the most sensitive .
Consistent with induction of apoptosis , AZD1480 activated caspases 9 and 3 , and induced poly ( adenosine diphosphate ribose ) polymerase cleavage .
( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2c </xref> ) .
This was observed as soon as after 24 h of incubation with AZD1480 in all cell lines , when high doses ( 5 μ ) were used ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure S1C </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> AZD1480 induces paradoxical hyperphosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2 at the activation loop in HL cells </sec-title>
Although AZD1480 inhibited phosphorylation of STATs , its effect on the phosphorylation of the JAK family members in HL cells is unknown .
Only the Tyr @-@ phosphorylated forms of JAKs are known to exhibit kinase activity , and phosphorylation at two tandem Tyr residues in the activation loop appears to be required for enzymatic activity . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"> 20 </xref> </sup>
As levels of baseline p-JAK2 expression and p-STATs inhibition did not predict sensitivity to AZD1480 in HD-LM2 and L-428 cells , we investigated the effect of AZD1480 on the phosphorylation status of the JAK family members at the activation loop .
To determine the effect of AZD1480 on p-JAKs , we focused our experiments on the three cell lines that expressed active JAK @/@ STAT proteins : HD-LM2 , L-428 and L-540 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3a </xref> ) .
In L-540 , which was the most sensitive cell line and which expressed only p-JAK3 , increasing concentrations of AZD1480 ( 0.1 @–@ 5 μ ) completely inhibited JAK3 Y980 phosphorylation .
In contrast , when HD-LM2 and L-428 cells were incubated with AZD1480 , a paradoxical increase in JAK2 Y1007 @/@ Y1008 and TYK2 Y1054 @/@ Y1055 phosphorylation was observed after 72 h of incubation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3a </xref> ) .
The hyperphosphorylation of JAK2 at the activation loop was confirmed using two antibodies obtained from different clones .
The phosphorylation of the immediate downstream target STAT3 was abrogated at the same time point in all the three cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1b </xref> ) , suggesting that the function of the JAKs was effectively inhibited by AZD1480 .
When JAKs phosphorylation was analyzed over a shorter time period , a strong increase in JAK2 Y1007 @/@ Y1008 phosphorylation was observed in HD-LM2 and L-428 cells after 30 min of incubation with 1 μ AZD1480 ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure S1A </xref> ) , whereas JAK3 Y980 phosphorylation was abrogated in L-540 cells ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure S1A </xref> ) .
The phosphorylation of the immediate downstream target STAT3 was abrogated at the same time point ( 30 min ) in all the three cell lines , suggesting that the function of the JAKs was effectively inhibited after 30 min of incubation with AZD1480 ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure S1A </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> AZD1480 induces a negative @-@ feedback loop involving phosphorylation ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and p38 </sec-title>
As AZD1480 inhibition of STATs activity did not translate into antiproliferative activity in two cell lines , we hypothesized that these cells may depend on other signaling pathways to promote their survival .
To test this hypothesis , we examined the effect of AZD1480 on ERK , p38 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase @/@ AKT signaling pathways , which are known to promote HL survival .
We found that AZD1480 had no effect on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase @/@ AKT signaling in any of these cell lines ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , AZD1480 increased the levels of ERK and p38 phosphorylation in the resistant HD-LM2 and L-428 cells , whereas it inhibited ERK and p38 phosphorylation in the sensitive L-540 cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3b </xref> ) .
To define the mechanism of ERK and p38 activation in the two resistant cell lines , we first assessed the expression and activation levels of the Src homology 2 domain @-@ containing protein phosphatase 2 ( SHP-2 ) and SOCS-3 ( a STAT3 target gene @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"> 21 </xref> </sup> ) , two known regulators of JAK @/@ STAT and mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling .
In fact , SHP-2 has been reported to be a negative regulator of the JAK @/@ STAT activation , whereas having a positive effect on ERK activation . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> 24 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"> 25 </xref> </sup>
Furthermore , numerous studies have described enhanced SHP-2 and ERK activation after <i> SOCS-3 </i> deletion in both <i> in vitro </i> and <i> in vivo </i> models , postulating a negative @-@ feedback loop between SOCS-3 and SHP-2 . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26"> 26 </xref> </sup>
Consistent with the described changes in ERK phosphorylation status , after 72 h of incubation with increasing doses of AZD1480 ( 0.1 @–@ 5 μ ) , an increase in SHP-2 phosphorylation on Tyr542 ( the major site of SHP-2 activation ) coupled with SOCS3 downregulation was observed in the HD-LM2 and L-428 cell lines , but not in the L-540 cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3b </xref> ) .
On the other hand , in the L-540 cells , SOCS3 downregulation was not coupled with SHP-2 hyperphosphorylation , and ERK phosphorylation was in fact inhibited after treatment with AZD1480 , suggesting a different model of MAPK activation in this cell line .
The activation of p38 signaling observed in the HD-LM2 and L-428 cell lines after incubation with AZD1480 was probably related to the activity of autocrine and paracrine chemokine and cytokine loops , triggered by SHP-2 @/@ ERK activation .
Over a shorter time period , we observed a strong correlation between SOCS-3 downregulation and SHP-2 @/@ ERK activation in the HD-LM2 cell line after 6 h of incubation with AZD1480 , whereas in the L-540 cell line , ERK phosphorylation was inhibited without an increase in SHP-2 phosphorylation or a decrease in SOCS-3 levels ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"> Supplementary Figure S1D </xref> ) .

Consistent with the observed changes in SHP2 , ERK and p38 phosphorylation , AZD1480 increased the production of IP-10 , RANTES and IL-8 in the supernatants of the resistant HD-LM2 and L-428 , and not the sensitive L-540 cells .
( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3c </xref> ) .
This data suggest that the efficacy of AZD1480 may have been attenuated in the HD-LM2 and L-428 cells by an autocrine negative @-@ feedback loop involving cytokines that activate ERK @/@ p38 survival signaling pathway .
<sec-title level="2"> MEK inhibitors enhance the efficacy of AZD1480 in the HD-LM2 and L-428 cell lines </sec-title>
To assess whether the observed activation of the SHP-2 @/@ ERK pathway is involved in the resistance to JAK @/@ STAT inhibition , HL cells were treated with 1 μ AZD1480 in combination with two commercially available MEK inhibitors ( UO126 and PD98059 ) .
Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of UO126 or PD98059 ( 10 @–@ 100 μ ) , with or without 1 μ AZD1480 for 24 , 48 and 72 h , and cell viability was assessed using the MTS assay .
Both UO126 and PD98059 enhanced the effect of AZD1480 in the HD-LM2 and L-428 cells at 72 h ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3d </xref> ) .
This effect was associated with inhibition of AZD1480 @-@ induced ERK phosphorylation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3e </xref> ) .

Therefore , we assessed the effect of AZD1480 on PD @-@ L1 and PD @-@ L2 expression in HL cells by flow cytometry .
After incubation with AZD1480 1 μ for 72 h , we observed a significant downregulation of PD @-@ L1 and PD @-@ L2 in the PD @-@ L1 @/@ PD @-@ L2 @-@ positive HL cell lines HD-LM2 and L-540 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4a and b </xref> ) .
No significant dowregulation was detected following incubation with MEK inhibitors ( UO126 and PD98059 25 μ for 72 h ) in the L-540 cell line ( data not shown ) .
On the other hand , in the HD-LM2 cell line , an increase in the activation of ERK was observed after incubation with AZD1480 , ruling out a role of this pathway in the regulation of PD ligands expression in this cell line ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3b </xref> ) .
Given the potent inhibition of STAT proteins phosphorylation observed with low doses AZD1480 ( 0.1 @–@ 1 μ ) , we also assessed the effect of AZD1480 on the expression of STAT @-@ regulated cytokines and chemokines involved in HL cell survival ( IL-6 ) and immune escape ( IL-13 , TARC ) , focusing on the three cell lines with baseline JAK @/@ STAT activation .
Following incubation with AZD1480 1 μ for 72 h , cell culture supernatants were analyzed by enzyme @-@ linked immunosorbent assay ; consistent with the inhibition of STAT3 and STAT6 phosphorylation , decreased levels of IL-6 , IL-13 and TARC were observed in HD-LM2 , L-428 and L-540 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4b </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> High concentrations of AZD1480 promote early G2 @/@ M arrest and cell death in HL cells by inhibiting Aurora kinases </sec-title>

In contrast , treatment with a lower AZD1480 concentration ( 1 μ ) for 24 h did not significantly affect the cell cycle fractions ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5a and b </xref> ) .
As AZD1480 was reported to inhibit Aurora A kinase in enzymatic assays , <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"> 14 </xref> </sup> we assessed whether the significant increase in the G2 @/@ M fraction observed in HL cell lines after incubation with 5 μ AZD1480 was related to the inhibition of Aurora A .
First , we analyzed the baseline expression of Aurora A and B kinases in exponentially growing HL cells by western blotting .
All four cell lines showed overexpression of Aurora A and B , and histone H3 , compared with PBMCs from healthy donors ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5c </xref> ) .
Aurora A kinase activity depends on autophosphorylation at Thr288 in the activation loop .
Thus , to determine the effect of AZD1480 on Aurora A kinase , we evaluated the levels of autophosphorylation at Thr288 by western blotting .
Cells were pretreated with nocodazole ( 400 ng @/@ ml ) for 18 h , to achieve a mitotic block , and then exposed to AZD1480 ( 1 or 5 μ ) with or without the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( 20 μ ; to prevent a potential override of the nocodazole @-@ induced mitotic block by proteasome @-@ dependent mechanisms ) for 3 h ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5d </xref> ) .
Dose @-@ dependent inhibition of Aurora A was detected after 3 h of incubation in all the four cell lines , and Thr288 autophosphorylation was abrogated when a higher dose of AZD1480 ( 5 μ ) was used ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5d </xref> ) .
These findings are consistent with the analysis of the cell cycle fractions , showing major dose @-@ dependent changes in the cell cycle after incubation with AZD1480 .
In L-428 and L-540 cells , a dose @-@ dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 was observed , suggesting a dual inhibition of Aurora A and B in these cell lines .

Sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor E6201 in melanoma cells is associated with mutant <i> BRAF </i> and wildtype <i> PTEN </i> status ( PMID : 23039341 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
The majority of melanoma cell lines were either sensitive ( IC50 < 500 nM , 24 @/@ 31 ) or hypersensitive ( IC50 < 100 nM , 18 @/@ 31 ) to E6201 .
This sensitivity correlated with wildtype <i> PTEN </i> and mutant <i> BRAF </i> status , whereas mutant <i> RAS </i> and PI3K pathway activation were associated with resistance .
Although MEK inhibitors predominantly exert a cytostatic effect , E6201 elicited a potent cytocidal effect on most of the sensitive lines studied , as evidenced by Annexin positivity and cell death ELISA .
Conversely , E6201 did not induce cell death in the two resistant melanoma cell lines tested .
E6201 inhibited xenograft tumour growth in all four melanoma cell lines studied to varying degrees , but a more pronounced anti @-@ tumour effect was observed for cell lines that previously demonstrated a cytocidal response <i> in vitro </i>@ .
<i> In vitro </i> combination studies of E6201 and LY294002 showed synergism in all six melanoma cell lines tested , as defined by a mean combination index < 1 .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Sensitivity to E6201 in a melanoma cell line panel </sec-title>
Sensitivity to E6201 was assessed in a panel of 31 cell lines for which the mutation status of common melanoma genes was known ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
These lines were chosen to represent different mutational profiles from a larger panel of more than one hundred melanoma cell lines .
Western blots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> Additional file 1 : Figure S1 </xref> confirm that E6201 efficiently inhibits MEK1 @/@ MEK2 activity by virtue of its ability to abrogate phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in our entire panel of melanoma cell lines .
The majority ( 24 @/@ 31 ) of the melanoma cell lines were sensitive to E6201 ( IC50 < 500 nM ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> ) .
MAPK activation due to mutations in <i> BRAF </i> and <i> NRAS </i> was not significantly associated with increased sensitivity to E6201 .
In the 26 cell lines carrying mutations in <i> BRAF </i> , <i> NRAS </i> , or <i> HRAS </i> , sensitivity to E6201 was statistically associated with wildtype <i> PTEN </i> status ( p = 0.02 ) .
Specifically , of the 18 cell lines with wildtype <i> PTEN </i> , 17 were sensitive whereas in the 8 cell lines with mutant <i> PTEN </i> , only 4 were sensitive .
Moreover , even if <i> PTEN </i> status alone is examined , E6201 sensitivity is associated , albeit non @-@ significantly , with wildtype <i> PTEN </i> status ; 23 @/@ 31 cell lines are wildtype for <i> PTEN </i> and of these 20 are sensitive ( whereas only 4 @/@ 8 cell lines with mutant <i> PTEN </i> are sensitive ) ( p = 0.053 ) .
Interestingly , 18 of the 24 sensitive cell lines also demonstrated hypersensitivity to E6201 , with an IC50 < 100 nM .
Using this criterion , <i> BRAF </i> mutation status correlated with E6201 hypersensitivity ( p < 0.03 ) , with 15 out of the 18 hypersensitive cell lines possessing a <i> BRAF </i> mutation .
In contrast , of the 11 cell lines with wildtype <i> BRAF </i> , only 3 were hypersensitive .
In those cell lines carrying mutations in <i> BRAF </i> ( 21 cell lines ) , sensitivity to E6201 was not statistically associated with wildtype <i> PTEN </i> status .
<i> NRAS @/@ HRAS </i> mutation status correlated with E6201 resistance , where none of the 5 <i> NRAS </i>@ / @<i> HRAS </i> mutant cell lines were hypersensitive to E6201 and 18 of the 26 <i> NRAS @/@ HRAS </i> wildtype cell lines were hypersensitive ( p < 0.01 ) .
Neither <i> CDKN2A </i> , <i> CDK4 </i> or <i> TP53 </i> mutational status in our panel of melanoma cell lines , irrespective of their <i> BRAF </i> and <i> RAS </i> mutational status , was associated with E6201 sensitivity .
<sec-title level="2"> E6201 sensitivity and downstream pathway activation </sec-title>
To determine whether E6201 responsiveness correlated with direct Akt or ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation , the phosphorylation status of Akt and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 proteins was evaluated following serum starvation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) .
Phosphorylated ( p ) Akt ( Ser473 ) was detectable in 7 @/@ 7 cell lines with mutant PTEN .
In addition , pAkt was present in 5 @/@ 23 cell lines with wildtype <i> PTEN </i> although the mechanism responsible for phosphorylation of Akt in these cell lines is unknown .
Phosphorylated ( p ) ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was detected in all cell lines with mutant <i> BRAF </i> ( 20 @/@ 20 ) .
Consistent with previous reports [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"> 13 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref>@ ] , elevated pERK1 @/@ pERK2 was detected in 3 @/@ 5 cell lines with mutant <i> NRAS </i> or <i> HRAS </i>@ .
All five cell lines with wildtype <i> BRAF </i> and <i> NRAS </i> also had elevated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation , as reported previously [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] , although the mechanism responsible for ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in these cell lines is unknown .
When the cell lines were classified based on phospho @-@ ERK levels rather than <i> BRAF </i> mutation status , there was no correlation with the degree of cell growth inhibition .
In contrast , high levels of pAkt ( 3+ ) in <i> BRAF @/@ RAS </i> mutant cell lines were strongly suggestive of insensitivity to E6201 ( p = 0.057 ) .
Furthermore , high levels of pAkt ( 3+ ) significantly correlated with E6201 insensitivity independent of <i> BRAF </i> or <i> PTEN </i> status ( p < 0.02 ) .
PTEN protein was present in 20 of the melanoma cell lines tested with a lack of the tumour suppressor being suggestive of resistance to E6201 in not only <i> BRAF @/@ RAS </i> mutant lines ( p = 0.12 ) but also if all lines are considered ( p = 0.14 ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Characterization of E6201 response <i> in vitro </i> </sec-title>
MEK inhibitors have been previously shown to have a predominantly cytostatic effect on melanoma cells , although some clinically relevant inhibitors , such as CI-1040 , PD0325901 and AZD6244 , have been shown to induce cell death [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"> 10 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"> 12 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"> 13 </xref>@ ] .
We sought to further evaluate the mechanism of sensitivity to E6201 , as an equivocal cytocidal response <i> in vitro </i> may equate to the poor clinical response observed with current MEK inhibitors .
Fifteen melanoma cell lines were selected such that 13 cell lines demonstrated sensitivity to E6201 and 2 cell lines were insensitive to E6201 .
Of these cell lines , seven were mutant for <i> BRAF </i> but wildtype for <i> PTEN </i> , five were mutant for both <i> BRAF </i>@ / @<i> NRAS </i> and <i> PTEN </i> , and three were wildtype for both <i> BRAF </i> and <i> PTEN </i>@ .
E6201 treatment induced G1 arrest in all of the sensitive cell lines and had little to no effect on cell cycle progression in the two insensitive cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A ) .
E6201 treatment resulted in a greater than 2 @-@ fold increase in Annexin @-@ positive staining in eleven out of fifteen cell lines , including eleven out of thirteen sensitive cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
Two sensitive cell lines , SKMEL13 and BL , did not demonstrate E6201 @-@ induced Annexin staining although both of these cell lines underwent cell cycle arrest with E6201 treatment and were hypersensitive to E6201 ( IC50 < 100 nM ) .
These experiments were repeated in duplicate to confirm this finding .
E6201 induced a less than two @-@ fold increase in Annexin staining in the E6201 @-@ insensitive cell lines ( IC50 > 500 nM ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
Three of the five <i> PTEN </i>@ -@ mutant cell lines exhibited a cytocidal response to E6201 , demonstrating that <i> PTEN </i> mutation does not preclude a cytocidal response to E6201 .
E6201 also induced cell cycle arrest and cell death in cell lines with constitutively active Akt , suggesting that although high pAkt correlates with E6201 insensitivity , cell lines with high pAkt can still undergo a cytocidal response to E6201 .
To confirm our Annexin V results we also performed an enzyme @-@ linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) to determine the degree of DNA fragmentation as an indicator of cell death with E6201 treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ C ) .
The results from the cell death ELISA were very similar to that obtained from the Annexin studies with 10 out of 13 sensitive melanoma lines demonstrating a greater than two @-@ fold increase in DNA fragmentation with E6201 .
Of the three sensitive lines that did not exhibit a cytocidal response by ELISA , SKMEL13 and BL also demonstrated no induction of cell death with E6201 by Annexin positivity , as stated previously .
There was no significant induction of DNA fragmentation in any of the E6201 @-@ resistant melanoma cell lines .
<sec-title level="2"> Characterization of E6201 response <i> in vivo </i> in melanoma xenografts </sec-title>
We evaluated the <i> in vivo </i> activity of E6201 in two melanoma cell lines that exhibited a cytocidal response ( MM540 , MM604 ) and two melanoma cell lines that exhibited a cytostatic response ( SKMEL13 , BL ) to E6201 <i> in vitro </i> ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref> ) .
Given that the majority of sensitive melanoma cell lines in our cell line panel exhibited a cytocidal response to E6201 <i> in vitro </i> , we hypothesized that E6201 would induce tumour regression in a xenograft model of these cell lines as well , and to a greater extent in those cell lines that demonstrated a cytocidal response to E6201 <i> in vitro </i> compared to those with a cytostatic response .
Administration of E6201 at all doses ( 10 , 20 and 40 mg @/@ kg ) to MM540 tumour @-@ bearing mice completely abrogated tumour growth and caused transient , partial tumour regression for the two weeks of drug treatment , although tumour growth recommenced following drug withdrawal , indicating not all cells were killed in this two week period ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ A ) .
E6201 at 40 mg @/@ kg in MM604 and SKMEL13 xenografts prevented tumour progression for the two weeks of drug treatment , with tumour growth recommencing following drug removal , while lower doses of drug ( 10 and 20 mg @/@ kg ) only attenuated , rather than prevented , tumour growth <i> in vivo </i> ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ B and C ) .
Only the highest dose of E6201 ( 40 mg @/@ kg ) had any significant inhibitory effect on tumour growth in BL tumour @-@ bearing mice , while lower drug doses had little or no effect on tumour progression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ D ) .
As such our hypothesis was confirmed , with E6201 inhibiting xenograft tumour growth in all four melanoma cell lines studied , and enhanced <i> in vivo </i> activity observed for those cell lines that demonstrated a cytocidal response <i> in vitro </i>@ .
<sec-title level="2"> E6201 and LY294002 </sec-title>
Given our previous data suggesting that E6201 resistance is associated with mutation of <i> PTEN </i> and high levels of pAkt , we hypothesized that combining E6201 with an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway in these cell lines might result in either an additive or synergistic effect .
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> Additional file 2 : Figure S2 </xref> demonstrates that LY294002 effectively inhibits PI3K by evidence of reduced phosphorylated AKT protein levels in the four <i> PTEN </i>@ -@ mutant melanoma cell lines that normally express high levels of pAKT ( UACC647 , UACC558 , UACC903 and MM622 ) .
In addition , <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> Additional file 3 : Figures S3 </xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4"> Additional file 4 : Figure S4 </xref> show the concentration @-@ effect curves for single @-@ agent LY294002 and E6201 respectively , where both drugs were added 24 hours following plating .
The six melanoma cell lines tested displayed similar trends in E6201 sensitivity compared to our previous experiments , with MM622 , MM540 , UACC903 , and WM35 being the most sensitive ( IC50 = 40 @-@ 61 nM ) and UACC558 and UACC647 being less sensitive ( 302 and 2310 nM , respectively ) .
Surprisingly , all cell lines showed similar sensitivity to LY294002 , with IC50 ranging from 11 μM to 17 μM .
This was unexpected , as one would predict MM540 and WM35 cells to be relatively resistant to PI3K inhibition given the lack of detectable levels of pAkt indicating no constitutive PI3K activation in these cell lines .
A previous study by Smalley and others [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref>@ ] , however , reported a similar sensitivity of WM35 cells to LY294002 .
The concentration response curves for E6201 and LY294002 combinations , normalized to a dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) control are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4"> Additional file 4 : Figure S4 </xref>@ .
As differences in synergy may exist at different drug effect levels , we graphed individual combination index values for LY294002 with increasing concentrations of E6201 for each cell line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ A ) .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ A , evaluating the individual combination index for all combinations tested revealed that E6201 and LY294002 exhibit synergistic activity in all six melanoma cell lines , irrespective of E6201 sensitivity or <i> PTEN </i> or pAkt status .
Interestingly , different patterns of synergy were observed among the groups of cell lines tested .
While most ( 4 @/@ 6 ) of the cell lines showed an increasing combination index ( and thus decreasing synergy ) at higher concentrations of E6201 , UACC647 and UACC558 cells showed a decreasing combination index or enhanced synergy with increasing concentrations of E6201 .
Notably , this pattern observed for UACC647 and UACC558 cells occurs within the context of high pAkt and relative resistance to E6201 , supporting the hypothesis that administration of a PI3K inhibitor can sensitize E6201 @-@ resistant cells with high pAkt levels to E6201 .
In summary , the combination of E6201 and LY294002 resulted in synergistic activity in all six melanoma cell lines tested , as defined by a combination index < 1 .
Interestingly , enhanced synergy of E6201 with LY294002 treatment in the E6201 @-@ resistant cell lines UACC647 and UACC558 was observed at high concentrations of E6201 .
Alternative dosing of dual PI3K and MEK inhibition in cancer therapy ( PMID : 23259591 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
Two of the 12 NSCLC cell lines tested , H3122 ( ALK translocated ) and H1437 ( triple @-@ negative ) , showed increased cytotoxicity upon dual MEK and PI3K inhibition .
Furthermore , MDA @-@ MB231 ( breast ) and HCT116 ( colon ) , showed increased cytotoxicity upon dual inhibition , as in previous studies .
Activation of parallel pathways in the dual inhibition @-@ sensitive lines was also noted in response to single inhibitor treatment .
Otherwise , no significant differences in downstream intracellular pathway activity ( S6 and 4E-BPI ) were noted between PI3K alone and dual inhibition other than the increased cytotoxicity of the latter .
In the alternative dosing schedules two out of the four dual inhibition @-@ sensitive cell lines showed similar cytotoxicity to continuous PI3K and short ( 15 min ) MEK inhibition treatment .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Dual inhibition of PI3K and MEK in cancer cell lines </sec-title>
The inhibitors used were ZSTK474 ( PI3K inhibitor ) and PI-103 ( PI3K and mTOR inhibitor ) and CI-1040 ( MEK inhibitor ) .
We first addressed the effects of these inhibitors alone in the NSCLC lines A549 ( <i> K </i>@ - @<i> Ras </i> mutant ) , HCC827 ( <i> EGFR </i> mutant ) and H3122 ( <i> EML4 </i>@ - @<i> ALK </i> translocated ) , representing the three most frequent oncogenic genotypes of the disease , to establish concentration frames for the target inhibition .
In the Western blots ZSTK474 at a 3.3μM concentration induced complete downregulation of pAKT , an immediate downstream target of PI3K , while PI-103 induced a similar inhibition at concentrations of 1 to 3.3 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) .
pS6 downregulation correlated highly with pAKT downregulation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> ) .
The MTS cytotoxicity assay showed a major reduction in the number of viable cells in all the cell lines with similar concentrations of both inhibitors , which were closely correlated with the concentrations inducing complete inhibition of pAKT in Western blot analysis ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1A </xref> , C ) .
CI-1040 induced complete inhibition of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , an immediate downstream target of MEK , at a 1 μM concentration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> ) .
Only the H3122 line showed any marked reduction in cell viability in the MTS assays in response to increasing concentrations of the inhibitor , correlating with maximal target inhibition , while the other lines displayed minor changes in viability , except for the 10 μM treatment in HCC827 , despite the achieving of complete inhibition of pERK1 @/@ pERK2 in all the lines tested at 1 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1C </xref> ) .
Dual inhibition of PI3K and MEK was tested in a panel of NSCLC lines ( n = 12 ) with the <i> K </i>@ - @<i> Ras </i> ( n = 3 ) , <i> EGFR </i> ( n = 3 ) , <i> ALK </i> ( n = 3 ) , or triple @-@ negative ( n = 3 ) oncogenic genotypes .
Analogously to the cell lines in the preliminary experiments , all the cell lines tested here showed a major reduction in cell growth in response to the PI3K inhibitors alone , with no significant differences between ZSTK474 or PI-103 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , eight of the twelve lines presented graphically ) .
The MEK inhibitor CI-1040 elicited variable responses with the majority of cell lines , showing only minor inhibition of growth or none at all .
When the cell lines were exposed to dual , concurrent inhibition of PI3K and MEK , two out of 12 tested cell lines , H3122 and H1437 , showed marked additional cytotoxicity compared with treatment with a single agent ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
The results were submitted to combination index ( CI ) analysis and average CI values were calculated based on combinations of ZSTK474 and PI-103 .
This analysis grouped the cell lines into three categories : antagonism ( n = 5 , CI 1.10 @-@ 3.3 ) , nearly additive or slight synergy ( n = 5 , CI 0.7 @-@ 1.10 ) , and synergy or strong synergy ( n = 2 , CI < 0.7 ) ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Visual assessment of the dual inhibition in MTS curves did not suggest any major antagonism of treatment in any of the lines tested , however , since the combination treatment curves in the cell lines with antagonistic CI values closely followed the single PI3K inhibitor treatment curves ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
There was no correlation between the cancer genotypes in responsiveness to the dual inhibition , since an <i> ALK </i> translocated line ( H3122 ) and a triple @-@ negative negative line ( H1437 ) showed synergistic responses to dual inhibition ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> , Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
The NSCLC lines showing synergistic responses to dual inhibition seemed to be more responsive to low concentrations ( < 1 μM ) of the MEK inhibitor alone ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2A </xref> ) .
Analogously to the single inhibitor results , the lines sensitive to dual inhibition showed only a minor difference between the activities of the different PI3K inhibitors in combination with the MEK inhibitor .
Based on a literature search [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"> 7 </xref>@ ] , additional cell lines known to be responsive to dual PI3K and MEK inhibition were studied .
MDA @-@ MB231 , a basal @-@ like breast cancer line , and HCT116 , a <i> K </i> <i> Ras </i> mutant colorectal line , were exposed to single inhibitors or dual inhibition and analyzed with the MTS assay .
As in the previous work , both the cell lines showed synergistic responses to dual inhibition ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> , Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
PI-103 was markedly less effective than ZSTK474 in the HCT116 cell line , while , like all the NSCLC cell lines , MDA @-@ MB231 responded similarly to both PI3K inhibitors ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2B </xref> , Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Interestingly , we did not see any differences in target inhibition between ZSTK474 and PI-103 in the HCT116 line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) , so that the mechanism of differential efficiency remains unknown .
The lines H3122 , H1437 , MDA @-@ MB231 , and HCT116 , which were sensitive to dual inhibition , were further analyzed with Western blot analysis for cleaved PARP , a well @-@ characterized marker of apoptosis .
No cleaved PARP was detected in any of the cell lines following the single agent treatments ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) , but when dual inhibition with either ZSTK474 or PI-103 was administered , marked PARP cleavage was seen in the H3122 line but not in the other lines tested ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A </xref> ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Effect of dual inhibition on cell signaling </sec-title>
The NSCLC ( H3122 and H1437 ) , breast cancer ( MDA @-@ MB231 ) and colon cancer ( HCT116 ) lines , which showing major synergy upon dual inhibition , were further studied for cell signaling in response to the inhibitors .
All the cell lines downregulated pAKT and its downstream target pS6 completely in response to 6h of treatment with the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 or PI-103 ( 3.3 μM ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
Downregulation of p4E @-@ BP1 was also noted with all the cell lines tested , but it was complete only in the H3122 cell line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
Furthermore , concurrent activation of pERK1 @/@ pERK2 was recognized in the H3122 , MDA @-@ MB231 and HCT116 cell lines during PI3K inhibitor treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
When the cell lines were treated with the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 ( 1 μM , 6 h ) , complete ( H3122 , H1437 ) or marked ( MDA @-@ MB231 , HCT116 ) downregulation of pERK1 @/@ pERK2 was seen ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
This was accompanied by upregulation of pAKT in the H3122 and MDA @-@ MB231 lines , but not by upregulation of pS6 or p4E @-@ BP1 ( H3122 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
p4E @-@ BP1 was markedly upregulated in the MDA @-@ MB231 line in response to CI-1040 treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
When the PI3K and MEK inhibitors were administered simultaneously the inhibition of the targets was similar to that seen with single inhibitor treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
Dual inhibition was able to overcome the single inhibitor @-@ induced stimulation of parallel pathway activation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
We were not able to detect any significant difference in the activity of either pS6 or p4E @-@ BP1 following dual inhibitor treatment as compared with the single PI3K inhibitor treatments ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
Further analysis of the dual inhibition of the central RTKs and signaling nodes was carried out with the PathScan Antibody Array , which investigates the phosphorylation status of 28 RTKs and 11 signaling nodes concurrently .
Attention was focused on the dual inhibition @-@ sensitive H1437 and MDA @-@ MB231 lines .
A low level of RTK activation was noted in untreated cells of both cell lines , H1437 showing some activity with c-MET ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) , while in the signaling nodes , pAKT , S6 and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 showed activity in both cell lines and Src activity was also noted in H1437 .
In the drug @-@ treated cells , ZSTK474 ( 24 h ) was able to inhibit both AKT and S6 phosphorylation , S6 showing a more pronounced effect ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) .
Furthermore , ZSTK474 induced a marked broad feedback RTK activation in the H1437 cell line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) .
CI-1040 ( 24 h ) effects were limited to the inhibition of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activity .
When dual inhibition with ZSTK474 and CI-1040 was administered , downregulation of both pAKT @/@ S6 and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was noted , but otherwise no marked difference was evident relative to the single agent treatments ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) .
The results suggest specificity of the inhibitors for their targets and the existence of broad feedback activation .
<sec-title level="2"> Alternative dosing of dual inhibition </sec-title>
Even though dual inhibition of PI3K and MEK was identified as an effective form of cancer therapy based on the <i> in vitro </i> models , administration of both drugs at doses inducing major downregulation of the target for long periods of time may be too toxic in a clinical setting .
We therefore set out to investigate concurrent administration of PI3K and MEK inhibitors to cell lines sensitive to dual inhibition with alternative dosing schedules .
The MTS assays showed that for maximal reduction in the number of living cells in all the lines , dual inhibition needed to be administered for longer periods of time .
The therapy was significantly more effective when it was administered throughout the 72 h experiment as compared with 15 min , 4 h or 24 h periods ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
Interestingly , maximal cytotoxicity was seen in the <i> ALK </i> translocated H3122 line even with short courses of ALK inhibition ( 15 min ) , while similar cytotoxicity was seen with 72 h inhibition of PI3K and MEK concurrently ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) , even though both approaches induced major inhibition of phosphorylated AKT and ERK in Western blots after 6 h treatments ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) .
Since the results showed that dual inhibition needed to be administered for longer periods of time for maximal cytotoxicity , we turned next to investigating whether both inhibitors are required throughout the period of exposure .
The dual inhibition @-@ sensitive cell lines were exposed to one inhibitor throughout the treatment period ( 72 h ) while the other inhibitor was administered concurrently for 15 min , 4 h or 24 h at the beginning of the drug exposure .
The results varied significantly between the cell lines tested .
In the H1437 and MDA @-@ MB231 lines concurrent inhibition of PI3K and MEK for 15 min with continued PI3K inhibition for 72 h achieved similar cytotoxicity to concurrent inhibition for 72 h ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
Conversely , when these lines were exposed to the MEK inhibitor throughout the treatment period , short concurrent exposures ( 15 min , 4 h or 24 h ) to PI3K inhibitors did not induce any comparable cytotoxicity ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
On the other hand , the effects of dual inhibition with PI-103 occurred faster in the H1437 line than with ZSTK474 , since shorter exposures to the drug ( 24 h ) seemed to be sufficient for maximal cytotoxicity as compared with 72h of ZSTK474 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
In the case of the H3122 and HCT116 lines , both the PI3K and MEK inhibitors needed to be administered throughout the treatment period for maximal cytotoxicity ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ) .
We next investigated alternative dosing of the dual inhibition of cell signaling .
The dual inhibition @-@ sensitive lines were exposed to the PI3K inhibitors and MEK inhibitor concurrently for 15 min , after which treatment was continued with a single inhibitor for the remainder of the 6 h period .
pAKT downregulation was complete or nearly complete when the cells were treated for only 15 min and with PI3K inhibitors for 6 h ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) , while conversely , pERK1 @/@ pERK2 recovered completely in 6 h when the cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor for 15 min ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
Interestingly , we were able to see some recovery in the activity of the downstream targets of AKT when the PI3K inhibitors were administered for 15 min despite the remaining pAKT downregulation .
The pS6 signal was able to recovery in the MDA @-@ MB231 ( with ZSTK474 ) and HCT116 ( with both PI3K inhibitors ) lines after short PI3K administration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
Furthermore , p4E @-@ BP1 recovery was noted in the H3122 ( with ZSTK474 ) , MDA @-@ MB231 ( with ZSTK474 ) , and HCT116 ( with both PI3K inhibitors ) lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
Interestingly , MEK inhibitor treatment induced upregulation of p4E @-@ BP1 in the MDA @-@ MB231 line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3A </xref> ) , and marked downregulation p4E @-@ BP1 was noted only with PI-103 ( PI3K and mTOR inhibitor ) in the alternative dosing experiments , but not with ZSTK474 ( with a PI3K inhibitor alone ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) , suggesting mTOR @-@ mediated activation of 4E-BP1 in response to MEK inhibition .
TAE684 , an ALK inhibitor , treatment was also included in the experiments conducted with the H3122 line , and this induced comparable pAKT , pERK1 @/@ pERK2 , and pS6 downregulation to that achieved with dual inhibition , whereas no change in p4E @-@ BPI was noted ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
Some recovery of pAKT and pS6 was seen after a short treatment with TAE684 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3B </xref> ) .
We went on further to analyze whether the alternative dosing could also result in apoptosis in the H3122 cell line , the only line identified as inducing apoptosis in response to dual inhibition .
When the cells was treated for 15 min with dual inhibition and treatment with either the PI3K inhibitors or the MEK inhibitor was continued for 48 h , marked PARP cleavage was seen in all the treatments ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
Furthermore , 15 min treatment with an ALK inhibitor resulted in marked PARP cleavage ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4B </xref> ) .
Cleaved PARP results were further verified with western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 , another marker for apoptosis .
Cleaved caspase-3 was detected with concurrent PI3K and MEK , or ALK inhibition while no signal was seen in PI3K or MEK inhibitor treatments .
Conversely to cleaved PARP , the cleaved caspase-3 signal was much lower in alternative dosing schedules compared to continuous , concurrent PI3K and MEK inhibition ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> ) .

The lines of therapy during which cetuximab was administered were 1 st line in 38 ( 16.8 % ) , 2 nd line in 108 ( 47.8 % ) , 3 rd and beyond in 80 ( 35.4 % ) ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Of note , as the period of therapy extended from 2004 until December 2008 , an unselected patient population received cetuximab @-@ based therapies , irrespective of KRAS mutational status .
<sec-title level="2"> mRNA markers and somatic genotypes </sec-title>
Out of the 199 samples tested for mRNA expression , three were found not eligible for all targets .
In total , 84.4 % of samples were eligible for AREG analysis ; 83.9 % for EGF ; 84.4 % for EGFR ; 80.4 % for EREG ; and 81.4 % for TGFa .
Out of the 226 DNA samples screened for the presence of mutations , genotyping was successful in 205 samples for KRAS ( 90.8 % ) , 159 ( 70.4 % ) for NRAS , 220 for BRAF and 220 for PIK3CA ( 97.3 % in each case ) ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> ) .
KRAS mutations were detected in 72 tumours ( 31.9 % ) , mostly in exon 2 , in codon 12 in 45 cases ( 20.0 % ) and in codon 13 in 16 cases ( 7.0 % ) , while BRAF V600E mutations were found in 6 cases ( 2.6 % ) .
NRAS mutations were also quite rare , found only in 7 cases ( 3.1 % ) .
PIK3CA mutations were detected in 37 tumours ( 16.4 % ) , 20 in exon 9 ( 8.8 % ) and only five in exon 20 ( 2.2 % ) .
This genotypic analysis was included in a previous publication [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref>@ ] .
Correlation analysis revealed that mutations in KRAS , BRAF , NRAS genes were mutually exclusive in all evaluable cases .
On the contrary , mutations in the PIK3CA gene co-existed with KRAS mutations in 17 cases and with NRAS mutations in two .
Statistically significant associations at the 2 @-@ sided p< 0.05 level were seen between wild type status of KRAS , BRAF genes and high AREG , EREG , EGFR mRNA levels .
Among KRAS @-@ wild type cases , 81.4 % were seen in AREG @-@ high and 57.4 % in EREG @-@ high tumours , while of KRAS @-@ mutated cases only 63.9 % were observed in AREG @-@ high and only 35.7 % in EREG @-@ high tumours .
Similarly , among BRAF @-@ wild type cases , 76.1 % were seen in AREG @-@ high and 50.7 % in EREG @-@ high tumours , while of BRAF @-@ mutated cases only two out of six ( 33.3 % ) were observed in AREG @-@ high and none in EREG @-@ high tumours .
Regarding the primary location , 64.8 % of KRAS mutations ( p = 0.07 ) and 58 % of PIK3CA mutations ( p = 0.036 ) occurred in left @-@ sided colorectal tumours , whereas four ( 66.7 % ) of BRAF mutations in right @-@ sided colon carcinomas ( p = 0.024 ) .
mRNA RQ values were examined as continuous variables and significant correlations at Spearmann ’s R> 0.4 were found between AREG and EREG mRNA ( R = 0.63 , 95 % CI 0.53 @-@ 0.72 , p = 0.0005 ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Factors with predictive significance at univariate analysis </sec-title>
At a median follow @-@ up of 73.6 months , 215 patients ( 95.1 % ) had experienced disease progression and 163 ( 93.1 % ) had died .
The median survival was was 27 months ( 95 % CI 25 @–@ 31 ) .
At univariate analysis , in the present cohort of patients treated with cetuximab the presence of BRAF mutations was significantly associated with an 8.1 @-@ fold increased risk of death compared to patients harbouring BRAF @-@ wild type tumours .
When all types of mutations were pooled for each gene , KRAS ( HR 1.28 , p = 0.14 ) , NRAS ( HR 1.43 , p = 0.36 ) and PIK3CA ( HR 1.27 , p = 0.25 ) mutations did not have prognostic @/@ predictive utility .
However , when types of mutations were analysed separately for each gene , KRAS codon 12 mutations were predictive for increased risk of death ( HR 1.62 , p = 0.014 ) .
Among parameters studied for gene expression , only the 25 th percentile of AREG mRNA values and the 75 th percentile of EREG mRNA values dichotomized cases into groups with different outcome and were selected as optimal cut @-@ offs .
None of EGF , TGFa , EGFR mRNA levels disclosed cut @-@ off points of prognostic significance .
Cetuximab therapy in patients harbouring AREG @-@ high ( HR 0.47 , p = 0.0002 ) or EREG @-@ high ( HR 0.45 , p = 0.0009 ) tumours resulted in reduced risk of death .
EGFR , EGF , TGFa mRNA expression had no significant prognostic @/@ predictive value , either in the entire cohort or in the KRAS @-@ wild type versus KRAS mutant cases .
Regarding objective tumour response to any line of cetuximab @-@ based therapy , tumoural AREG and EREG mRNA expression levels were associated with tumour shrinkage as continuous variables .
AREG was not statistically significant as categorical variable but EREG mRNA at the 75 th percentile was associated with a 2.26 @-@ fold increased likelihood of tumour response to cetuximab compared to tumours with lower EREG mRNA expression .
AREG failed to predict response in either KRAS wild type or mutated cases .
The expression levels of EREG in the tumours of responding and non @-@ responding patients by KRAS gene status is depicted in a waterfall plot ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Of note , in an exploratory analysis , the predictive significance for objective response was maintained only in KRAS mutated CRC , in which EREG had an odds ratio for response of 5.4 ( 95 % CI 1.2 @-@ 23.8 , p = 0.024 ) .
By contrast , in KRAS @-@ wild type tumours EREG failed to significantly predict for response to therapy ( OR 2.2 , 95 % CI 0.83 @-@ 5.86 , p = 0.11 ) .
EGF , TGFa and EGFR mRNA expression had no predictive utility for response to cetuximab in the whole cohort , neither in KRAS wild-type or KRAS mutated cases .
All factors with potential predictive utility for cetuximab benefit are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3"> 3 </xref>@ .
<sec-title level="2"> Interactions and factors with predictive utility at multivariate analysis </sec-title>
Significant interactions ( at the 1 % significance level ) between study variables for prognostic @/@ predictive utility ( survival , ORR ) were sought .
In terms of impact on survival , significant interactions were found between AREG mRNA levels and mutational status of the KRAS gene ( p = 0.0033 ) .
High mRNA levels of AREG predicted for longer survival in patients with KRAS wild-type ( median survival 33 vs. 15 months , p = 0.0005 , Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) , but not in KRAS mutant tumours ( median survival 22 vs. 17 months , p = 0.64 ) .
In contrast , high mRNA levels of EREG were associated with favourable prognosis irrespective of KRAS mutational status .
In KRAS wild type cases , the median survival was 37 months for EREG @-@ high as compared to 23 months for EREG @-@ low expressing tumours ( p = 0.01 ) , while in KRAS mutated tumours median survival was 33 versus 19 months ( p = 0.02 ) in EREG @-@ high vs. low cases ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ) .
Similar findings for EREG high vs. low were seen when we examined complex cancer genotypes : a ) KRAS+BRAF , both wild type vs. any mutant , b ) KRAS+BRAF+PIK3CA+NRAS , all wild type vs. any mutant .
AREG mRNA had a favourable predictive significance in wild type cases only , whereas EREG mRNA preserved its significance in wild type as well as in mutant cases .
A multivariate analysis was performed in the context of a broader mRNA profiling project of several biomarkers ( IGFBP2 , IGF1R , cMET , EGFR , TGFa , EphA2 , HER2 , HER3 , HER4 , Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> ) .
In the presence of wild-type KRAS , high AREG mRNA levels were independently associated with 83.0 % reduction in the risk of death compared to patients with AREG @-@ low tumours .
High EREG tumoural mRNA was a favourable outcome predictor for cetuximab @-@ treated patients , irrespective of KRAS mutation status .
High Ephrin A2 ( EphA2 ) mRNA and advanced age were adverse independent prognosticators .
Finally , among cetuximab @-@ treated patients with AREG @-@ low tumours , those with mutant KRAS fared significantly better than patients harbouring colon cancer with KRAS wild type ( 81 % decreased risk of death ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Impact of distinct types of KRAS and PIK3CA mutations on outcome of cetuximab @-@ treated patients </sec-title>
We examined different types of KRAS and PIK3CA mutations for potentially distinct impact on patient survival .
Regarding KRAS , cetuximab @-@ treated patients with codon 12 mutations had a median survival of 19 months ( 95 % CI 15 @–@ 26 ) , significantly lower ( p = 0.033 ) than the median survival of patients with other KRAS mutations ( 30 months , 95 % CI 20 @–@ 35 ) and that of patients with wild-type KRAS ( 29 months , 95 % CI 25 @–@ 35 ) .
Further subgroup analyses showed that the median survival in patients with codon 12 KRAS mutations was also lower than the median survival of all other patient subgroups ( other KRAS mutations or KRAS wild-type ) .
Specifically , patients with codon 13 mutations reached a median survival of 28 months ( 95 % CI 16 @–@ 39 ) , those with other rarer KRAS mutations a median survival of 33 months ( 95 % CI 16 @–@ 42 ) and patients with KRAS wild-type tumours a median survival of 29 months ( 95 % CI 25 @–@ 35 ) .
Despite the rather small size of compared subgroups , a trend for statistical significance was evident ( p = 0.068 , Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref> ) .
No difference in patient outcomes was found when we compared tumours with PIK3CA exon 9 versus exon 20 mutations versus PIK3CA wild-type status , as survival times clustered from 25 to 29 months ( p = 0.31 ) .
The only complex genotype that harboured significance for cetuximab benefit was CG3 ( p = 0.019 ) : Patients with tumours wild-type for all PIK3CA , KRAS , BRAF reached a median survival of 32 months ( 95 % CI 25 @–@ 36 ) , those with a PIK3CA mutation along with KRAS or BRAF mutation had a median survival of 26 months ( 95 % CI 16 @–@ 32 ) while patients with any single mutation in KRAS , BRAF or PIK3CA genes had a median survival of 22 months ( 95 % CI 19 @–@ 28 ) .
Apparently , concurrent mutations in PIK3CA along with KRAS or BRAF mutations carried rather weak additional adverse prediction .
MEK inhibitors as a chemotherapeutic intervention in multiple myeloma ( PMID : 23524590 )
The Ras @/@ Raf @/@ MEK @/@ extracellular signal regulated kinase ( ERK ) ( Ras @/@ mitogen @-@ activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) ) signal transduction pathway is a crucial mediator of many fundamental biological processes , including cellular proliferation , survival , angiogenesis and migration .
Aberrant signalling through the Ras @/@ MAPK cascade is common in a wide array of malignancies , including multiple myeloma ( MM ) , making it an appealing candidate for the development of novel targeted therapies .
In this review , we explore our current understanding of the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway and its role in MM .
Additionally , we summarise the current status of small molecule inhibitors of MEK under clinical evaluation , and discuss future approaches required to optimise their use .
<sec-title level="1"> Introduction </sec-title>
Mitogen @-@ activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) are a family of ubiquitously expressed serine @/@ threonine kinases that transmit diverse cell surface signals throughout the cell .
MAPK pathways consist of a three @-@ tiered signalling module activated via a phosphorylation cascade .
The most proximal kinase in these pathways , the MAPK kinase kinase ( MAPKKK or MAP3k ) , engaged by extracellular signals , phosphorylates a dual specificity MAPK kinase ( MAPKK or MAP2K ) , which in turn phosphorylates and actives the distil effector MAPK .
Mammalian MAPK pathways are represented by the Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase ( ERK ) , c-Jun N-terminal kinase , p38 , ERK 5 , ERK 3 @/@ 4 and ERK 7 @/@ 8 pathways . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"> 1 </xref> </sup>
The Ras @/@ MAPK pathway is the best characterised of the mammalian MAPK signal transduction networks , consisting of the Ras proteins , a family of small G @-@ coupled molecules , the Raf kinases ( MAP3K ) , the MAP2K kinases ( MEK1 and MEK2 ) and the pathway distil kinases ERK1 and ERK2 .
The Ras @/@ MAPK network is frequently deregulated in malignancy and contributes to many of the hallmarks of oncogenesis , including abnormal cellular proliferation , impaired apoptosis , enhanced angiogenesis , metastasis and the development of drug resistance . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"> 2 </xref> </sup>
MEK lies at a critical juncture within the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway , having a limited number of direct upstream MAP3K activators and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 as its only known cellular targets , thereby making it an attractive target for cancer therapy .
Several MEK inhibitors have been developed and investigated in preclinical and clinical models .
Results from these studies have been promising and suggest that MEK inhibitors , whether alone or in combination with other anticancer therapies , may have a significant role to play in the future management of malignancy .
Current management strategies for multiple myeloma ( MM ) involve conventional chemotherapeutics and novel anti @-@ MM agents ( thalidomide , lenalidomide and bortezomib ) , with or without subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3"> 3 </xref> </sup>
Although these anticancer therapies are typically effective initially , MM remains a fatal and largely incurable disease .
This is due to the high frequency of relapse and the eventual development of drug resistance .
Accumulative genetic changes within malignant plasma cells , together with MM interplay with the bone marrow microenvironment ( BMME ) , potentiate disease progression by promoting the deregulation of multiple signal transduction networks , one of which is the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"> 5 </xref> </sup>
This suggests that MM patients may benefit from the abrogation of this kinase network through the administration of a MEK inhibitor .
Here , we discuss the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway , its involvement in MM and the role of MEK inhibitors in the future management of the disease .
<sec-title level="2"> Overview of the Ras @/@ Raf @/@ MEK @/@ ERK pathway </sec-title>
Members of the Ras protein subfamily ( H-, K @- and N-Ras ) function as molecular switches in cellular signal transduction .
Diverse growth factor , mitogen and cytokine engagement of cognate receptors leads to the recruitment of the GDP @/@ GTP exchange factors , growth @-@ factor @-@ receptor bound protein 2 ( Grp2 ) and Sons of Sevenless ( SOS ) to the plasma membrane where Ras resides .
The grp2 @/@ SOS complex then promotes inactive Ras to exchange GDP with GTP and enters an activated state . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"> 6 </xref> </sup>
Activated Ras then recruits Raf to the cell membrane , where it is activated by phosphorylation .
This process is antagonised by GTPase @-@ activating proteins , which promote GTP hydrolysis and the formation of inactive Ras @-@ GDP complexes . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"> 7 </xref> </sup>
Approximately 30 % of malignancies contain activating mutations in a Ras proto @-@ oncogene , with pancreatic ( 90 % ) , colon ( 50 % ) and thyroid ( 50 % ) carcinomas demonstrating the highest prevalence .
Mutations typically affect K-Ras and N-Ras , but rarely H-Ras , and occur in a mutually exclusive manner . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"> 8 </xref> </sup>
The Raf family of serine @/@ threonine kinases ( A-, B @- and c-Raf ( Raf-1 ) ) lie at the apex of the MEK @/@ ERK pathway .
All three Raf isoforms share similar structural characteristics .
However , they differ in their ability to phosphorylate and activate MEK , with B-Raf demonstrating higher basal kinase activity compared with Raf-1 and A-Raf . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"> 9 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"> 10 </xref> </sup>
Activating B-Raf mutations have been described in 66 % of melanomas and to a lesser degree in other solid tumours . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"> 11 </xref> </sup>
The clinical relevance of this association is reinforced by the exquisite sensitivity of these B-Raf mutated tumours to MEK inhibition . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"> 12 </xref> </sup>
Despite a high prevalence of activating B-Raf mutations in melanoma and solid tumours , these mutations are infrequent in MM . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"> 13 </xref> </sup>
This suggests that molecules other than B-Raf or alternative kinase pathways may have a crucial role in MM tumourigenesis .
MEK is a unique dual specificity kinase that phosphorylates both serine @/@ threonine and tyrosine residues . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"> 14 </xref> </sup>
MEK consists of two isoforms , MEK1 and MEK2 , which in turn phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2 . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"> 15 </xref> </sup>
Activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 control a diverse range of cellular processes through their many substrates ( > 160 ) that are located in cellular membranes , the cytoplasm and nucleus .
Many of these are transcription factors that are important in cellular proliferation , differentiation , survival , angiogenesis and migration . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"> 16 </xref> </sup>
Physiological activation of the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway is also influenced by multiple mechanisms .
Inhibitory molecules , such as Sprouty proteins ( SPRY ) and MAPK phosphatases ( MKP or DUSPs ) , engage the pathway at different points to negatively regulate signalling . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"> 17 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"> 18 </xref> </sup>
Activated ERK induces the expression of these inhibitory factors .
For example , certain DUSPs , induced by ERK @-@ regulated transcription factors , dephosphorylate ERK . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"> 19 </xref> </sup>
Downstream signalling from B-Raf , Raf-1 and MEK1 may also be diminished following ERK @-@ mediated phosphorylation . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"> 20 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"> 21 </xref> </sup>
These various mechanisms fine tune the activity of the Ras @/@ MAPK cascade through the creation of a negative @-@ feedback loop .
As will be discussed later , this mode of regulation has implications for inhibitors targeting the pathway .
<sec-title level="2"> The Ras @/@ MAPK pathway and MM </sec-title>
The genetic changes associated with MM are complex and heterogeneous .
Increasing evidence suggests that the disease evolves through a multistep transformation process , involving the gain or loss of whole chromosomes , nonrandom chromosomal translocations involving the IgH locus and point mutations . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"> 4 </xref> </sup>
These aberrations , which influence the clinical and pathological features of MM are manifest in variable disease progression and therapeutic outcomes .
Several of these molecular alterations lead to deregulated activation of the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway .
The t ( 4;14 ) translocation that juxtaposes the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene and a strong IgH enhancer , resulting in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 overexpression , stimulates the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway , an outcome typically associated with abnormal cellular proliferation and apoptosis . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"> 22 </xref> </sup>
Activating Ras mutations , which have a reported incidence varying between 32 @–@ 50 % in MM , are also thought to deregulate this pathway . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> 24 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"> 25 </xref> </sup>
K-Ras and N @- Ras are the most frequently mutated , with oncogenic H-Ras being a rare phenomenon . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"> 25 </xref> </sup>
While certain genetic lesions common to MM ( for example , t ( 14;16 ) , t ( 4;14 ) and hyperdiploidy ) are also present in the asymptomatic precursor to MM , monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance , <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26"> 26 </xref> </sup> Ras mutations occur almost exclusively in MM .
This indicates that Ras mutations are likely to contribute to the transition of the disease from a premalignant state . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"> 27 </xref> </sup>
In the case of the t ( 4 @:@ 14 ) lesion that can activate the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway , this raises the interesting possibility that deregulation of the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway in monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance precedes constitutive MAPK activation associated with Ras mutations .
Patients with MM harbouring oncogenic K-Ras often have a worse clinical outcomes compared with those with N-Ras mutations or wild-type Ras <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> 24 </xref> </sup> This link is exemplified by Ras mutations being associated with the evolution of MM from an intermedullary disease to a more advanced extramedullary phenotype . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"> 28 </xref> </sup>
These observations suggest that aberrant MEK @/@ ERK signalling has an important role in MM disease progression and prognosis .
Malignant plasma cell and BMME interactions are thought to contribute to disease progression through the induction of various cytokines and growth factors , a number of which mediate their effects through the Ras @/@ MAPK cascade . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"> 5 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"> 29 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"> 30 </xref> </sup>
In addition to a number of these cytokines being able to activate MEK @/@ ERK via the classical Ras @/@ Raf link , another MAP3K , Tpl2 ( Cot , MAP3K8 ) , a known oncogene , has emerged as being important in the cytokine @-@ induced activation of ERK in various cell types , in particular hemopoietic cells . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"> 31 </xref> </sup>
The observation that the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily cytokines ( tumour necrosis factor-α , BAFF ) , CD40 and RANK ligands , all of which have been implicate in MM , activate MEK @/@ ERK via Tpl2 raises the likelihood that the MEK @/@ ERK arm of this MAPK pathway can be activated through different MAP3K . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32"> 32 </xref> </sup>
With aberrant MEK @/@ ERK signalling thought to be important in regulating the growth , survival , migration and drug resistance of MM , it will be interesting to determine if specific MAP3Ks differentially control these particular features of the disease .
Interactions between Bcl-2 @-@ like prosurvival and BH3 @-@ only pro @-@ apoptotic family members play an integral role in controlling the balance between cell survival and death though the intrinsic apoptosis pathway .
Aberrant expression of these apoptotic regulatory molecules in diverse cancers , including MM , contributes to drug resistance .
Importantly , the activity of a number of these proteins is modulated by MEK @/@ ERK signalling .
For example , ERK @-@ mediated phosphorylation of the antiapoptotic molecule , Mcl-1 , decreases its degradation , thereby promoting cell survival . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33"> 33 </xref> </sup>
With the overexpression of Mcl-1 , a common feature of MM associated with greater relapse and shorter survival , <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"> 34 </xref> </sup> constitutive MEK @/@ ERK activity almost certainly contributes to elevated Mcl-1 expression in those MM with lesions in the Ras @/@ ERK pathway .
In contrast , Bim , a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that can bind to and neutralize Mcl-1 , is targeted by ERK phosphorylation for proteasome @-@ dependent degradation . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"> 35 </xref> </sup>
Hence , constitutive ERK signalling is likely to contribute significantly to MM survival by stabilising Mcl-1 and diminishing Bim expression .
The activity of other prosurvival ( Bcl-2 and Bcl @-@ xL ) and proapoptotic ( Bad ) Bcl-2 @-@ like proteins , that are also known to be regulated by ERK signalling , represent additional candidates that may contribute to the enhanced survival of MM cells .
<sec-title level="2"> MEK inhibitors </sec-title>
MEK1 and MEK2 are homologous dual specificity kinases that share ERK as their only known catalytic substrate , <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"> 15 </xref> </sup> making MEK an appealing target for cancer drug development .
Although many kinase inhibitors target the ATP @-@ binding region of an enzyme , MEK contains a hydrophobic allosteric pocket adjacent to the ATP @-@ binding site that is not shared with other kinases . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36"> 36 </xref> </sup>
This offers the opportunity to design highly selective inhibitors of MEK that do not simply target the conserved ATP region of the kinase .
In the remainder of the review , we describe some of the various MEK inhibitors currently being investigated and their future role in cancer therapy .
<sec-title level="2"> Prototypic MEK inhibitors </sec-title>
Despite demonstrating <i> in vitro </i> activity , major <i> in vivo </i> limitations were identified for the early first generation MEK inhibitors , PD098059 @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37"> 37 </xref> </sup> and U0126 . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38"> 38 </xref> </sup>
Although both compounds were deemed unsuitable for clinical consideration they have proven to be invaluable tools for investigating the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway .
CI-1040 ( PD184352 ) was the first MEK inhibitor to demonstrate tumour inhibitory activity <i> in vivo </i>@ . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"> 39 </xref> </sup>
Encouraging phase I results in advanced cancer patients , where one patient with pancreatic cancer achieved a partial response ( PR ) lasting 12 months , prompted a phase II study of CI-1040 in patients with advanced solid tumours . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> 40 </xref> </sup>
However , in contrast to the phase I trial , no PR was observed . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41"> 41 </xref> </sup>
As a result of its weak antitumour activity , development of CI-1040 was terminated in favour of the more potent PD0325901 .
Compared with CI-1040 , PD0325901 demonstrates significantly improved potency in cell @-@ based assays ( 100 @-@ fold ) , oral bioavailability and metabolic stability . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"> 42 </xref> </sup>
Phase I investigation of PD0325901 was conducted in 66 advanced cancer patients .
Three of 48 evaluable patients with melanoma achieved PR , while 10 had stable disease ( s.d. ) for ≥ 4 months .
A subset of these patients developed retinal vein occlusion . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43"> 43 </xref> </sup>
A phase II study of PD0325901 was assessed in 34 advanced non @-@ small cell lung carcinoma patients , but was eventually terminated owing to lack of objective responses and increasing concerns about ocular function and neurotoxicity at therapeutic doses . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44"> 44 </xref> </sup>
Investigation of these treatment @-@ related toxicities was conducted in animal models , where PD0325901 was found to cause retinal vein occlusion in rabbits .
This adverse effect was attributed to the abrogation of phosphorylated @-@ ERK ( p-ERK ) within the brain . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45"> 45 </xref> </sup>
In light of these observations , development of PD0325901 has been suspended .
<sec-title level="2"> MEK inhibitors in development </sec-title>
AZD6244 @/@ ARRY-142886 ( selumetinib ) is a potent MEK inhibitor that has demonstrated significant tumour suppressive activity in a number of preclinical solid tumour models . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"> 46 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47"> 47 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48"> 48 </xref> </sup>
In cell @-@ based enzymatic assays , AZD6244 inhibited purified MEK at an IC @<sub> 50 </sub> of 14.1 ± 0.79 nM , with no inhibition observed at 10 μℳ against 40 other kinases .
Cell lines harbouring oncogenic B-Raf and N-Ras mutations displayed enhanced sensitivity to AZD6244 , whereas K-Ras mutated tumours showed variable responsiveness . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47"> 47 </xref> </sup>
In 2004 , a total of 57 patients with advanced cancer were treated in a phase I evaluation of AZD6244 .
The best clinical response achieved was s.d. ≥ for 5 months in 9 patients , with 2 patients maintaining s.d. for 19 and 22 months .
Similar to PD0325901 , blurred vision was reported in 7 patients ; however , neurotoxicity was not observed . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49"> 49 </xref> </sup>
Several phase II trials have since examined the effectiveness of AZD6244 in a diverse range of solid tumours . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50"> 50 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51"> 51 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52"> 52 </xref> </sup>
In each of these studies , the efficacy and tolerability of AZD6244 was compared with a conventional chemotherapeutic agent .

<sec-title level="2"> Enhancing effectiveness with combination therapies </sec-title>
Despite improvements in clinical potency and pharmacokinetics , MEK inhibitors have generally shown limited effectiveness as monotherapeutic agents .
Several reasons may account for this observation .
Abrogation of Ras @/@ MAPK signalling appears to be mainly cytostatic , and suggests that an additional therapeutic modality is required to maximise the antitumour effectiveness of MEK inhibitors .
In hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft models , AZD6244 in conjunction with doxorubicin demonstrated enhanced growth suppression ( 76 % ± 7 ) , compared with AZD6244 ( 52 ± 15 % ) and doxorubicin ( 12 ± 9 % ) alone .
This synergy was associated with increased apoptosis . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63"> 63 </xref> </sup>
Similar effects have been observed with AZD6244 and docetaxel in malignant melanoma , <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64"> 64 </xref> </sup> and AZD6244 and cytarabine in acute myelogenous leukaemia . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65"> 65 </xref> </sup>
The mechanism by which these agents cooperate is not entirely clear , but the available evidence suggests that many of these drugs can activate the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway through diverse processes , thereby increasing the effectiveness of MEK inhibitors . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66"> 66 </xref> </sup>
However , the inhibitory effects of MEK on cell cycle progression may potentially reduce the effectiveness of many standard chemotherapeutic agents in combination therapy , due to the reliance of these agents on killing malignant cells that are rapidly dividing .
Therefore , drug scheduling may have a critical role in the optimal utilisation of MEK inhibitors when combined with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs .
In this regard , Yu <i> et al. </i> <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67"> 67 </xref> </sup> have demonstrated that incubating leukaemic cells with paclitaxel before PD98059 exposure significantly increased cell death .
In contrast , pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor reduced the susceptibility of cells to paclitaxel @-@ induced apoptosis .
Activating mutations within the Ras @/@ MAPK network also contribute to the mechanisms of resistance to MEK inhibitors .
A number of studies have demonstrated that oncogenic amplification of K-Ras and B-Raf confers decreased susceptibility to AZD6244 . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68"> 68 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69"> 69 </xref> </sup>
Point mutations within MEK1 may also significantly attenuate the ability of MEK inhibitors to block ERK signalling in B-Raf V600E mutated tumours . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70"> 70 </xref> </sup>
These oncogenic events result in constitutive ERK pathway activation .
In the absence of oncogenic Ras and Raf mutations , other oncogenic events that engage the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway are also likely to stimulate normal feedback mechanisms that may increase the activity of various intermediaries in the Ras @/@ MAPK signalling module , thereby promoting the ongoing activation of ERK kinase signalling . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71"> 71 </xref> </sup>
For either scenario , the activity of ERK and its target substrates may be maintained at levels that are sufficient to drive key cellular functions even in the presence of a MEK inhibitor .
These observations suggest that targeting multiple nodes within the Ras @/@ MAPK network may be a more efficacious clinical strategy than single target therapy .
The contribution of multiple signalling networks to tumorigenesis also accounts for the limited responses seen with MEK inhibitors alone .
For example , the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K @/@ Akt @/@ mTOR ) and MAPK pathways share Ras as a common upstream effector . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72"> 72 </xref> </sup>
Consequently , activation of Ras , despite the downregulation of ERK activity by MKPs and SPRYs , could lead to compensatory signalling through this parallel network .
Alternatively , oncogenic mutations within the PI3K @/@ Akt axis may enhance MEK @/@ ERK signal transduction .
Indeed , dysregulation of the PI3K @/@ Akt pathway has been shown to correlate with the decreased sensitivity to MEK inhibition . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73"> 73 </xref> </sup>
Predictably targeting both pathways simultaneously has proven effective in several studies .
In AZD6244 @-@ resistant gastric cancer cell lines , activation of Akt through the EGFR @/@ PI3K @/@ Akt pathway was still observed following MEK inhibition .
Blockade of this pathway using the EGFR inhibitor , gefitinib , synergistically enhanced tumour apoptosis <i> in vitro </i> and <i> in vivo </i>@ . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74"> 74 </xref> </sup>
Treatment of mutant murine lung cancers with the dual PI3K @/@ mTOR inhibitor , NVP @-@ BEZ235 and AZD6244 produced similar results . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75"> 75 </xref> </sup>
Recently , preliminary results from a phase I trial evaluating the combined activity of GDC-0973 @/@ XL-518 and the Akt inhibitor , GDC-0941 , found that in a cohort of 27 advanced solid tumour patients , three patients achieved prolonged s.d. ≥ 6 months when treated with both agents . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76"> 76 </xref> </sup>
Promising clinical activity has also been observed in the phase I trial of GSK1120212 in conjunction with the Akt inhibitor , GSK2141795 . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77"> 77 </xref> </sup>
The number of preclinical and clinical studies investigating dual Ras @/@ MAPK and PI3K @/@ Akt inhibition indicates a growing trend to using these combinations to maximise antitumour response .
Aberrant signalling through additional kinase pathways may also contribute to MEK inhibitor resistance .
For example , although non @-@ small cell lung carcinomas carry both K-Ras and PTEN mutations , resistance of these cell lines to AZD6244 coincides with activation of the Janus kinase @/@ signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway ( JAK @/@ STAT ) following MEK inhibition . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78"> 78 </xref> </sup>
AZD6244 combined with STAT3 inhibition synergistically induced apoptosis in these cells .
This effect can be explained by STAT3 suppressing the proapoptotic protein Bim through upregulation of miRNA-17 , which antagonises the Bim expression induced by AZD6244 . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79"> 79 </xref> </sup>
Collectively , these results provide a rationale for combining inhibitors of the JAK @/@ STAT pathway and MEK inhibitors to reduce the potential impact of drug resistance .
Information about the use of MEK inhibitors and other kinase pathway inhibitors is unknown .
<sec-title level="2"> The role of MEK inhibitors in MM </sec-title>
The advent of novel anti @-@ MM agents has improved the management and prognosis of MM .
With the immunomodulatory drugs , thalidomide and lenalidomide , and the proteasome inhibitor , bortezomib , able to abrogate the survival advantage created by the BMME , current research has focussed on combining these novel therapies to improve patient outcomes . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80"> 80 </xref> </sup>
To date , promising results have been obtained in several clinical trials . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81"> 81 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82"> 82 </xref> </sup>
However , despite the clinical success of thalidomide , lenalidomide and bortezomib , a subset of patients do not initially respond to or ultimately become refractory to these agents . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83"> 83 </xref> </sup>
This emphasises the need for innovative anti @-@ MM therapies .
The impact of AZD6244 has been investigated in MM cells within the BMME . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84"> 84 </xref> </sup>
This compound specifically abrogated constitutive and cytokine @-@ stimulated ERK phosphorylation and induced cytotoxicity in a panel of human myeloma cell lines ( HMCL ) .
Responses to AZD6244 were also witnessed in tumour cells derived from MM patients with advanced disease .
These results suggest that AZD6244 is effective at advanced stages of disease , where MM cells are less reliant on the growth factors produced by the BMME .
Furthermore , culturing of HMCL and patient @-@ derived samples in the presence of exogenous interleukin-6 or bone marrow stromal cells did not protect against AZD6244 @-@ induced apoptosis .
Synergistically enhanced cell death was noted in combinations of AZD6244 with conventional ( dexamethasone ) and novel ( bortezomib , lenalidomide , perifisone ) anti @-@ MM agents .
AZD6244 as a single agent was also examined in an <i> in vivo </i> human plasmocytoma xenograft model and demonstrated prolonged survival when compared with control animals .
Breitkreutz <i> et al. </i> <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85"> 85 </xref> </sup> have also investigated the consequences of AZD6244 administration on osteoclast differentiation , function and cytokine secretion in MM .
AZD6244 blocked osteoclast differentiation and bone reabsorption in a dose @-@ dependent manner .
Furthermore , critical MM growth factors produced by the BMME , including interleukin-6 , BAFF , APRIL and MIP-1α were all significantly reduced following AZD6244 treatment .
Taken together , these results indicate that AZD6244 is able to abrogate paracrine signal dependent MM cell survival within the bone marrow niche .
Both these studies provide a preclinical rationale for the further evaluation of AZD6244 .
A phase II trial examining the compound in MM is presently ongoing .
Treatment with AS703026 has also been explored in MM . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86"> 86 </xref> </sup>
AS703026 inhibits HMCL and cytokine @-@ induced osteoclast differentiation more potently ( 9 @- to 10 @-@ fold ) than AZD6244 , with an IC @<sub> 50 </sub> ranging from 0.005 @–@ 2 μℳ.
No discernable relationship between Ras or Raf mutational status and the sensitivity of HMCL to AS703026 was observed .
This compound also induced apoptosis in HMCL cultured in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells .
Further evaluation of AS703026 in conjunction with conventional ( dexamethasone , melphalan ) and novel ( lenalidomide , bortezomib , perifisone , rapamycin ) anti @-@ MM therapies revealed synergistic cytotoxicity against HMCL and patient samples .
Lastly , for tumour cells isolated from patients with relapsed @/@ refractory MM treated with AS703026 at concentrations below 200 nℳ, dose @-@ dependent cytotoxicity was observed for 15 of 18 patient MM samples .
In this cohort of MM patient samples , while six and two of the patient samples harboured K-Ras @/@ N-Ras and B-Raf mutations , respectively , the presence or absence of Ras or B-Raf mutations did not correlate with the sensitivity to MEK inhibition by AS703026 .
Despite these encouraging findings , outcomes from solid tumour models suggest that combination regimes are required to maximise the effectiveness of MEK inhibitors in MM .
AZD6244 and AS703026 have demonstrated improved potency when used in combination with other anti @-@ MM agents . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84"> 84 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85"> 85 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86"> 86 </xref> </sup>
The contribution of additional signalling pathways to MM tumorigenesis also offers the opportunity to target MEK in conjunction with the inhibition of these biochemical networks .
Chatterjee <i> et al. </i> <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"> 30 </xref> </sup> have determined that the combined disruption of the Ras @/@ MAPK and JAK @/@ STAT pathway is required to induce MM apoptosis in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells .
Similarly , the contribution PI3K @/@ Akt and nuclear factor kappa @-@ light @-@ chain @-@ enhancer of activated B cells ( NFκB ) pathway deregulation exerts on MM and drug resistance also makes these pathways attractive targets for co-inhibition with MEK specific agents . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"> 5 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"> 29 </xref> </sup>
Several other small molecule inhibitors have also recently emerged as promising therapies in MM .
Histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) represent a family of enzymes that control transcription by modifying histones .
Overexpression of HDAC in MM prevents the transcription of various tumour @-@ suppressor genes , which in turn enhances cellular proliferation and represses cell death . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87"> 87 </xref> </sup>
Inhibition of HDAC activity reverses these outcomes , culminating in the accumulation of acetylated histones that promote the apoptosis of malignant cells . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88"> 88 </xref> </sup>
Clinical evaluation of the HDAC inhibitors as single agents in relapsed @/@ refractory MM patients has yielded modest response rates . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89"> 89 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90"> 90 </xref> </sup>
Nevertheless , several studies have reported a significant increase in the anti @-@ MM effect of these agents , when used in conjunction with conventional anti @-@ MM chemotherapeutics , <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91"> 91 </xref> </sup> lenalidomide and bortezomib . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92"> 92 </xref> </sup>
Combinations of MEK and HDAC inhibitors have been limited to preclinical studies involving chronic myelogenous leukaemia and non @-@ small cell lung carcinoma cell lines , but preliminary results have been promising . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93"> 93 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94"> 94 </xref> </sup>
Heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90 ) is a molecular chaperone that regulates many of the proteins involved in Ras @/@ MAPK , PI3K @/@ Akt , JAK @/@ STAT and NFκB signalling , as well other biochemical pathways that control apoptosis and cell cycle progression . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95"> 95 </xref> </sup>
Consistent with these properties , inhibition of HSP90 has been shown to disrupt multiple pathways crucial to MM survival . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96"> 96 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97"> 97 </xref> </sup>
While co-treatment of MM cells with a MEK and HSP90 inhibitors might serve as a means of attenuating the feedback mechanisms that promote resistance to MEK inhibitors , the clinical efficacy of these approaches is dependent upon how selective and active these combination regimes are <i> in vivo </i>@ .
In particular , the potential interrupting multiple kinase networks has for increasing the likelihood of adverse effects and drug toxicity is likely to be an important factor in determining the optimal use of these agents .
<sec-title level="2"> Predicting patient responses to MEK inhibitors : identification of relevant biomarkers </sec-title>
As all MEK inhibitors tested to date demonstrate potent and selective activity against MEK1 @/@ MEK2 , toxicity profiles and drug exposure are likely to be the key criteria that refine these drugs for therapeutic use .
Furthermore , it has become clear that certain genetic sub @-@ types in solid tumours are associated with increased susceptibility or resistance to MEK inhibitors .
This observation highlights the need for a reliable marker of responsiveness to MEK inhibitors , allowing tailoring of individualised therapies and reducing the occurrence of adverse events .
Currently it remains difficult to determine which patients will benefit most from MEK inhibitor treatment .
Whilst activating B-Raf mutations are associated with exquisite sensitivity against these agents , other biochemical markers demonstrate less predictability .
For example , the poor correlation between MEK inhibitor susceptibility Ras genotypes and p-ERK expression is well documented . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"> 12 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41"> 41 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"> 46 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47"> 47 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48"> 48 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60"> 60 </xref> </sup>
In one study , analysis of transcriptional pathway signatures in various solid tumours , identified a panel of 18 genes , the expression of which correlated with responsiveness to AZD6244 . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98"> 98 </xref> </sup>
This signature contained transcriptional targets of ERK involved in negative @-@ feedback regulation ( DUSP4 @/@ DUSP6 and SPRY2 ) , members of the Ets family of transcription factors ( ETV4 , ETV5 and ELF1 ) and other genes associated with MAPK signalling , cell cycle progression and tumour prognosis .
A 13 @-@ gene signature was also identified that was predictive of resistance to AZD6244 .
This diverse set of genes shared common links with transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) , tumour necrosis factor-α and NFκB signalling .
The role of these genes in MM and their potential predictive value for MEK inhibitor responsiveness has not been appraised .
Recent data published by Annuziata <i> et al. </i> <sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99"> 99 </xref> </sup> has reported the use of the musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma ( MAF ) oncogene as a potential biomarker for MEK inhibitor responses in MM .
In approximately 10 % of cases , aberrant MAF expression is due to a ( 14;16 ) translocation .
High levels of MAF were also observed in patient samples with t ( 4;14 ) translocations .
Both t ( 4 @:@ 16 ) and t ( 4;14 ) translocations correlate with disease progression and worse overall survival .
The MEK @/@ ERK pathway was found to regulate transcription of the MAF proto @-@ oncogene through ERK activation of FOS , a finding consistent with MAF protein and mRNA levels being downregulated following MEK inhibition .
To examine the dependence of MM cells on MEK @/@ ERK signalling , U0126 was administered to 16 HMCL that represented the heterogeneous onco @-@ genetics of the disease .
Of the 10 HMCL killed by this MEK inhibitor in a dose @-@ dependent manner , 9 cell lines exhibited a t ( 4;16 ) or t ( 4;14 ) translocation and over expressed MAF .
Moreover , the cytotoxic effect of U0126 was not neutralised by the presence of bone marrow stromal cells and remarkably , the impact of MEK inhibition on MM viability could be rescued by exogenous MAF expression .
Importantly , this study provides a mechanistic rationale for using MEK inhibitor therapy in MM patients that overexpress c-MAF .
These findings emphasise the potential benefit of genetic profiling to identify patients with MAF @-@ expressing MM who may benefit from this class of agents .
As part of the phase II trial of AZD6244 in relapsed @/@ refractory MM , extensive molecular profiling of a subset of patients was conducted to correlate the genetic characteristics of MM with clinical outcomes .
To date , detailed clinical data from eight patients has been analysed , four of whom overexpress c-MAF or MAF-B .
One patient ( fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ) had a very good PR lasting 8 months .
Another patient ( MAF-B ) had a PR of 6 months .
Finally , two patients ( one MAF-B , one pending results ) demonstrated s.d. of > 5 and 13 months , respectively . @<sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100"> 100 </xref> </sup>
Additional studies with larger sample sizes are required to support or refute MAF expression as a reliable biomarker for MEK inhibition .
<sec-title level="1"> Conclusion </sec-title>
The Ras @/@ Raf @/@ MEK @/@ ERK pathway has an established role in the various neoplastic phenotypes observed in many malignancies .
Deregulation of this pathway is also a common feature of MM , and contributes to the relapsing and refractory nature of the disease .
These observations make this pathway an attractive target for pharmaceutical investigation , with a number of MEK inhibitors having been developed and evaluated clinically .
Although preclinical studies of MEK inhibitors in MM have demonstrated a capacity to induce MM apoptosis by overcoming the prosurvival effects of the BMME , solid tumour studies indicate that the therapeutic benefit of MEK inhibitors alone are likely to be of limited benefit .
Therefore , future clinical approaches require a shift towards using MEK inhibitors in combination with current anti @-@ MM compounds and other novel small molecule inhibitors .
The identification of relevant biomarkers of MEK inhibitor responses remains a high priority that can be used to predict patient sensitivity and to tailor individualised therapies .

The p.Thr58_Met72dup duplication occurred in one tumor carrying a <i> PIK3CA </i> p.His1047Tyr substitution .
Two tumors with <i> KRAS </i> Ala146Thr mutations also had a <i> PIK3CA </i> mutation , either p.Glu545Lys or p.His1046Arg .

The frequency of <i> BRAF </i> p.Val600Glu mutations found in this series was 4.0 % ( 8 @/@ 201 ) .

<sec-title level="2"> BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> Initiates a Serrated Pathway to Intestinal Tumorigenesis </sec-title>
To examine the effect of <i> Braf </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> in the intestine , we created a <i> Braf </i> knockin allele , which can be activated by Cre , leading to the production of the V637E mutant Braf protein .
<i> Braf </i> <sup> <i> V637E </i> </sup> in mouse exon 18 is at the orthologous position of the human <i> BRAF </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mutation affecting exon 15 .
In the absence of Cre , a Lox @-@ Stop @-@ Lox cassette located in intron 17 prevents expression of the mutant allele ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1 </xref>@ A–1D ) .
To direct mutant Braf expression to the intestine , we used <i> Villin @-@ Cre </i> ( <i> Vil @-@ Cre </i> ) mice in which Cre is broadly expressed in epithelia of the small and large intestine ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26"> Madison et al. , 2002 </xref> ) .
In <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E/+ </i> </sup> mice the stop cassette at the <i> Braf </i> locus is excised specifically in the intestine but not in other organs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1 </xref>@ E ) .
The murine <i> Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i> </sup> allele is a knockin allele and is thus expressed from the endogenous <i> Braf </i> locus at physiologic levels .
All <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> animals developed lifelong persistent generalized crypt hyperplasia affecting nearly every crypt , leading to significantly elongated and thickened small and large intestines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1 </xref>@ F–1P ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figure S1 </xref>@ A available online ) .
Endoscopically and histologically , villi in the small intestine ( SI ) had a thickened and deformed appearance and were often branched ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1 </xref>@ I–1L ) .
Changes in the large intestine ( LI ) included crypt hyperplasia and mucosal protrusions resembling villous structures that replaced the normal crypt pattern ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1 </xref>@ M–1P ) .
This generalized hyperplasia was characterized by focal serrated epithelial formations , which had cytomorphologic features of human microvesicular or goblet cell @-@ rich hyperplastic ( serrated ) polyps ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1 </xref>@ Q–1T and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> S1 </xref>@ B ) .
Both types were present in the LI , whereas microvesicular hyperplasia was predominant in the SI .
Because of this resemblance to human serrated hyperplasia ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figure S1 </xref>@ B ) , we refer to the histology in the mouse as murine serrated hyperplasia ( mSH ) .
Like in human serrated hyperplastic polyps , there was a mild increase in the number of proliferating cells in mSH as compared to wild-type mucosa ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figures S1 </xref>@ C and S1D ) .
Ki67 @-@ positive cells were present in the mid and @/@ or upper crypt in <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> intestines but were restricted to the lower crypt in wild-type intestines ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figure S1 </xref>@ C ) .
Hyperproliferation seems to be the underlying mechanism of the hyperplastic changes because apoptosis was not reduced in <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> intestines as compared to wild-type mucosa ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figures S1 </xref>@ E and S1F ) .
We also intercrossed <i> LSL @-@ Braf </i> <sup> <i> V600E </i> </sup> mice with <i> Lgr5 @-@ EGFP @-@ IRES @-@ CreERT2 </i> knockin mice .
Tamoxifen @-@ inducible Lgr5 @-@ Cre allowed stochastic activation of mutant Braf in a part of the intestinal stem cells , thereby inducing hyperplastic polyps in nonhyperplastic surrounding mucosa ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figure S1 </xref>@ G ) .
<i> BRAF </i> mutations have been observed in human serrated polyps occurring sporadically or in serrated polyposis syndrome and we show here that BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> is indeed the underlying initiating event that is sufficient to induce lifelong sustained hyperplasia .
<sec-title level="2"> BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> Induced Serrated Tumorigenesis Progresses through a Hyperplasia @/@ Adenoma @/@ Carcinoma Sequence </sec-title>
To investigate whether mSH progresses to dysplasia , we aged <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup>@ mice up to 18 months and sacrificed them at various time points .
Hyperplasia to dysplasia progression was often observed at a young age ( 2 @–@ 3 months ) , at which time some animals already developed macroscopic tumors ( > 2 mm ) with dysplasia .
At 10 months , virtually all mice had such dysplastic lesions , often large numbers ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Histologically , Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ induced dysplastic lesions had features of human traditional serrated adenomas ( TSAs ) , including crypt elongation and a serrated eosinophilic adenomatous epithelium ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figures 2 </xref>@ B–2E and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> S1 </xref>@ B ) .
Although both TSAs and SSAs are associated with mutant <i> BRAF </i> in humans , we did not observe SSA in our model .
A possible reason is that mouse tumors were predominantly in the SI ( only five of 95 tumors were in the large intestine ) , where the specific morphologic features of human colonic SSAs might not develop .
To avoid misleading nomenclature by drawing inadequate morphologic parallels between murine SI lesions and human LI tumors , we refer to dysplastic lesions as “ murine serrated adenoma with dysplasia ” ( mSA ) or more specifically as mSA with low @-@ grade dysplasia ( mSA @-@ LGD ) or high @-@ grade dysplasia ( mSA @-@ HGD ) .
Macroscopically , Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced neoplasia resembled human <i> BRAF </i> mutant colonic tumors , which frequently show a nonpolypoid sessile growth pattern ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figure S2 </xref>@ A ) .
Proliferation rates were increased on average 2.4 @-@ fold in mSA @-@ LGD and 9.1 @-@ fold in mSA @-@ HGD as compared to hyperplasia ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figures S2 </xref>@ B–2D ) .
Like human <i> BRAF </i> mutant tumors , mouse mSAs frequently showed abundant mucin production and stained positive for Alcian blue ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figure S2 </xref>@ E ) .
In a subset of mice ( n = 5 ) dysplasia progressed to invasive carcinomas : 8.3 % ( 1 @/@ 12 ) of <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> mice younger than 10 months and 13.8 % ( 4 @/@ 29 ) of mice older 10 months had cancers ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Two of these cancers were low @-@ grade tumors ( well and moderately differentiated ) , and three were high @-@ grade cancers ( poorly or undifferentiated ; glandular structures in less than 50 % of the tumor ) .
Examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figures 2 </xref>@ F–2I .
Across a larger set of Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ induced cancers in <i> p53 </i> or <i> p16 </i> mutant backgrounds ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Table S1 </xref> and detailed below ) , we found that 30 % of tumors were high grade .
Collectively these results describe a mouse model of serrated intestinal cancer , which provides functional evidence for the key role of mutant <i> Braf </i> in tumor initiation .
<sec-title level="2"> Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ Induced Murine Intestinal Tumors Are Frequently Microsatellite @-@ Unstable </sec-title>
High level microsatellite instability ( MSI-H ) occurs in 50 % of human <i> BRAF </i> mutant cancers ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38"> Rajagopalan et al. , 2002 </xref> ) .
It is however not understood at which stage MSI develops and whether <i> BRAF </i> mutations are cause or consequence of MSI .
To address this question , we assessed the MSI status in Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced serrated hyperplasia and neoplasia as well as in <i> Msh2 </i> <sup> − @<i> / </i>@ − </sup> and <i> Apc </i> <sup> <i> min </i> </sup> control tumors .
A panel of eight microsatellite repeats was used for MSI typing ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ J ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Supplemental Experimental Procedures </xref> ) .
We found that all Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced hyperplastic polyps ( 13 @/@ 13 ) were microsatellite stable ( MSS ) or MSI @-@ low ( MSI-L ) .
Contrarily , 39.4 % ( 13 @/@ 33 ) of Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced mSAs and carcinomas were MSI-H and only 6 % ( 2 @/@ 32 ) were MSS ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ J ) .
MSI-H was observed at similar frequencies in mSAs ( 10 @/@ 25 ; 40 % ) and carcinomas ( 3 @/@ 8 ; 37.5 % ) .
<i> Apc </i> <sup> <i> min </i> </sup>@ -@ induced adenomas were all ( 9 @/@ 9 ; 100 % ) MSS or MSI-L .
The lack of MSI-H in mSH , but its presence in all subsequent stages of tumorigenesis ( mSA @-@ LGD , mSA @-@ HGD and carcinoma ) suggests its early development during Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ initiated transformation .
<sec-title level="2"> P53 Tumor Suppression Inhibits Invasion and Metastasis but Does Not Affect Tumor Initiation in Braf @<sup> <i> V637E </i> </sup>@ -@ Induced Tumorigenesis </sec-title>
The long latency and low penetrance of cancer development might be explained by the ability of constitutive MAPK signaling to activate anti @-@ oncogenic programs , most notably the <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> INK4a </i> </sup>@ /Rb and <i> p19 </i> <sup> <i> ARF </i> </sup>@ /p53 pathways ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33 bib25"> Palmero et al. , 1998 ; Lin et al. , 1998 </xref> ) .
To investigate the role of <i> p53 </i> in Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced intestinal tumorigenesis , we used <i> p53 </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ R172H/+ </i> </sup> knockin mice , expressing the equivalent of the dominant @-@ negative human <i> TP53 </i> <sup> <i> R175H </i> </sup> conditionally ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32"> Olive et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
We intercrossed them with <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> mice , aged the different double @- and triple @-@ transgenic cohorts , and monitored mice for tumor development ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ A ) .
We found that the average number of mSAs per mouse was similar in <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> and <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p53 </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ R172H/+ </i> </sup> animals ( 2.3 and 1.8 , respectively ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ B ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Table S2 </xref> ) .
Likewise , the proportion of mice developing mSAs did not differ between groups ( 82.9 % and 82.8 % , respectively , <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Table S2 </xref> ) , suggesting that the p53 pathway does not restrain dysplasia initiation .
In sharp contrast , invasive cancers were found considerably more frequently in <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p53 </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ R172H/+ </i> </sup> mice ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ B ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Table S3 </xref> ) .
Fifty @-@ six percent of <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p53 </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ R172H/+ </i> </sup> animals at an age of 10 @–@ 20 months had carcinomas , as compared to 13.8 % of mice in the <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> cohort ( p = 0.002 , χ @<sup> 2 </sup> test ) .
The average number of cancers was 5.2 times higher in the <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p53 </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ R172H/+ </i> </sup> cohort ( p = 0.007 ; Mann @-@ Whitney rank sum test ) .
Some animals had more than one synchronous cancer and 25 % ( 3 @/@ 12 ) of mice with cancer had metastases to local lymph nodes , pancreas , or lungs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3 </xref>@ C and 3D ) .
All together , these data show that p53 does not affect early stages of Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced tumorigenesis but plays an important role in invasiveness control .
<sec-title level="2"> Activation of p53 Tumor Suppression during Advanced , but Not Early Tumorigenesis </sec-title>
We next examined at which stage of tumorigenesis the p53 pathway becomes activated ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3 </xref>@ E–3N ) .
We performed immunohistochemistry for p53 and its target gene p21 in wild-type as well as <i> Braf </i> mutant hyperplasia and neoplasia .
Immunoreactivity for p53 was negative in all wild-type intestines ( n = 21 ) , all Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ induced mSHs ( n = 43 ) , and most mSAs @-@ LGD ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3 </xref>@ F–3H and 3N ) .
Only 5 @/@ 37 mSAs @-@ LGD were p53 @-@ positive ( example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ I ) .
We detected however marked p53 expression in 97 % ( 28 @/@ 29 ) of mSAs @-@ HGD ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3 </xref>@ L and 3N ) .
There was a strong concordance of p53 and p21 immunoreactivity in all samples .
Similar to p53 , p21 IHC was negative in all wild-type intestines ( n = 21 ) , all Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ induced mSHs ( n = 15 ) , and most ( 10 @/@ 11 ) mSAs @-@ LGD but was present in the majority ( 8 @/@ 9 ; 89 % ) of mSAs @-@ HGD ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3 </xref>@ G , 3J , 3M , and 3N ) .
These data suggest selective activation of p53 tumor suppression during advanced but not early stages of tumor evolution .
To investigate the mechanism of p53 activation , we first stained for the DNA damage marker γH2AX .
Oncogene @-@ induced DNA damage can activate p53 via ARF @-@ independent pathways ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44"> Sherr and McCormick , 2002 </xref> ) .
All mSHs ( n = 20 ) or mSAs @-@ LGD ( n = 12 ) were γH2AX @-@ negative ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ K ) , and only three of 17 mSAs @-@ HGD ( all p53 @/@ p21 @-@ positive ) showed evidence for activation of the DNA damage response .
In contrast , p19 @<sup> Arf </sup> expression increased substantially during tumor progression : average normalized p19 @<sup> Arf </sup> mRNA levels were similar in Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced mSHs ( 0.7 ) and wild-type mucosa ( 1.0 ) , but were increased 9.9-, 32.3-, and 39.4 @-@ fold in mSAs @-@ LGD , mSAs @-@ HGD , and carcinomas , respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ E ) .
We conclude that p53 is activated mainly via p19 @<sup> Arf </sup> in advanced Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ iduced tumorigenesis , explaining its late stage specific function .
<sec-title level="2"> Selective Pressure for p53 Inactivation Develops at Advanced Stages of Tumor Evolution </sec-title>
To examine whether <i> p53 </i> mutations occur spontaneously during Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ induced intestinal tumorigenesis , we next sequenced <i> p53 </i> in <i> Braf </i> mutant tumors .
Whereas mSAs ( n = 17 ) did not have <i> p53 </i> mutations , we identified a missense mutation ( S152R ; equivalent of human T155A ) in one of the two carcinomas .
S152R leads to stabilization of nonfunctional p53 , as evidenced by loss of p21 expression in cancer cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3 </xref>@ O–3Q ) .
In the second cancer , p53 expression was lost whereas the surrounding dysplasia , which gave rise to the cancer , was p53 @-@ positive ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figures 3 </xref>@ R and 3S ) .
These results suggest late stage specific selective pressure to inactivate p53 , further supporting the importance of p53 for invasiveness control .
<sec-title level="2"> Inactivation of p16 Promotes Advanced Phases of Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ Induced Intestinal Tumorigenesis </sec-title>
To examine the role of <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> , we first analyzed <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> expression in <i> Braf </i> mutant healthy and neoplastic intestines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref>@ A ) .
Whereas <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> expression was similar in <i> Braf </i> mutant mSH and WT mucosa , there was a marked upregulation of <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> expression in <i> Braf </i> mutant neoplasia .
This effect was less pronounced in mSAs @-@ LGD than in mSAs @-@ HGD , in which <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> was induced on average 100 @-@ fold ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref>@ A ) .
Thus , similarly to Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced Arf @/@ p53 activation , substantial p16 @<sup> Ink4a </sup> activation is only triggered at advanced stages of tumorigenesis .
This is consistent with observations in humans , where <i> p16 </i> was upregulated in <i> BRAF </i> mutant premalignant lesions ( SSAs and TSAs ) but not in hyperplasia ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"> Kriegl et al. , 2011 </xref> ) .
To investigate whether <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> inactivation occurs spontaneously in Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced tumors , we performed comparative genomic hybridization , sequencing , and methylation analysis of the <i> cdkn2a </i> locus .
We did not identify <i> Cdkn2a </i> mutations or copy number alterations in any of the 12 TSAs and eight carcinomas analyzed ( data not shown ) .
In a subset of Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ induced mSAs @-@ HGD and carcinomas , however , we found partial CpG island methylation in the <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> ( but not <i> p19 </i> <sup> <i> Arf </i> </sup> ) promoter ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figure S3 </xref> ) , similar to observations in humans ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"> Kriegl et al. , 2011 </xref> ) .
To study the effect of <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> inactivation in vivo , we used <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a @<sup> ∗ </sup> </i> </sup> mice , which have a point mutation that is silent in the <i> p19 </i> <sup> <i> Arf </i> </sup> reading frame but introduces a stop codon in <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> Krimpenfort et al. , 2001 </xref> ) .
<i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> mice with heterozygous or homozygous mutation of <i> p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a </i> </sup> <i> ( Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a @<sup> ∗ </sup> </i> </sup> <i> ) </i> were aged and sacrificed at different time points to assess tumor incidence and latency ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref>@ B ) .
We observed 1.3 @-@ fold increased numbers of mSAs in <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a @<sup> ∗ </sup> </i> </sup> animals as compared to <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> mice , but this was statistically not significant ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref>@ C ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Table S4 </xref> ) .
In contrast , carcinoma development was significantly increased in <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4 @<sup> ∗ </sup> </i> </sup> mice , which had on average 6.4 times as many cancers as <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p16 </i> <sup> <i> Ink4a +/+ </i> </sup> mice ( p < 0.001 ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref>@ C ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Table S5 </xref> ) .
Many of the mice developed multiple synchronous carcinomas and , in some animals ( 3 @/@ 24 ) , these tumors were metastatic .
All together , these results show that Arf @/@ p53 and p16 exert independent critical tumor @-@ suppressive effects , which are mainly operative at advanced stages of Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ induced intestinal tumorigenesis .
<sec-title level="2"> Intensification of Map Kinase Signaling during Dysplasia Progression </sec-title>
Because Braf @-@ induced Mapk signaling does not seem to engage intrinsic tumor suppression in early tumorigenesis , we next assessed the MAPK pathway activity at different stages of tumor evolution .
Unexpectedly , phospho @-@ p42 @/@ p44 MAPK ( pErk ) protein levels were only slightly increased in Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced mSH as compared to wild-type mucosa but were highly induced in mSAs and carcinomas ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref>@ A ) .
Immunohistochemistry revealed that in wild-type mucosa and Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced mSH , pErk reactivity was mostly confined to the lower parts of the crypts ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figures 5 </xref>@ B and 5C ) .
In mSAs @-@ LGD , few scattered pERK @-@ positive cells were occasionally additionally detected in dysplastic areas ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref>@ D ) .
mSAs @-@ HGD and carcinomas , however , stained uniformly positive for pErk ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figures 5 </xref>@ E–5G ) .

To assess the functional relevance of these observations , we examined expression of a panel of 15 Erk target genes ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"> Pratilas et al. , 2009 </xref> ) using qRT @-@ PCR ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref>@ H ) or immunohistochemistry ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figure S4 </xref> ) .
The panel of markers includes a number of effectors of Ras @/@ Raf @-@ induced transformation , such as the ETS family members <i> Etv4 </i> and <i> Etv5 </i> or <i> cMyc </i> and <i> Ccnd1 </i> , and genes involved in the feedback regulation of Mek @/@ Erk signaling , such as <i> Dusp4 </i> , <i> Dusp6 </i> , <i> Spry2 </i> , and <i> Spry4 </i>@ .
We found that the transcriptional output of the Erk pathway was only slightly induced in Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ dependent mSH and mSAs @-@ LGD ( average fold @-@ change across target genes : 1.1 and 3.4 , respectively ) but was strongly upregulated in mSAs @-@ HGD and carcinomas ( average fold @-@ change across target genes : 13.0 and 12.6 , respectively ) .
The extent of induction varied between markers and was highest for Fosl1 ( 60 @-@ fold induction in Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced mSAs @-@ HGD ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Wnt Pathway Activation during Dysplasia Progression </sec-title>
To examine the role of the Wnt pathway in Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced tumorigenesis , we first analyzed the expression of ten different Wnt target genes in a total of 78 samples ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figures 6 </xref>@ A and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> S5 </xref> ) .
We found that Wnt target gene expression was similar in wild-type mucosa and Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced mSH but was upregulated in a large number of Braf @<sup> V6 @<i> 37 </i>@ E </sup>@ -@ induced mSAs @-@ HGD ( and occasionally in mSAs @-@ LGD ) to similar levels as in <i> Apc </i> <sup> <i> min </i> </sup>@ -@ induced tumors .
Immunohistochemical staining of beta-catenin ( <i> Ctnnb1 </i> ) , a key effector of Wnt pathway activation , was performed to further confirm these observations .
As in wild-type mucosa , there was no evidence for nuclear β-catenin accumulation in mSHs ( n = 42 ) and the majority of mSAs @-@ LGD ( 14 @/@ 15 ) .
In contrast , there was diffuse or focal nuclear β-catenin accumulation in a substantial part of mSAs @-@ HGD ( 8 @/@ 14 ) and carcinomas ( 2 @/@ 4 ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figures 6 </xref>@ B–6F ) .
To analyze the mechanisms of Wnt pathway activation , we performed whole @-@ exome sequencing of 20 <i> Braf </i> mutant tumors .
We identified a number of mutations in known Wnt pathway genes ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Table S6 </xref> ) , including intracellular components of the Wnt pathway ( e.g. , <i> Apc </i> , <i> Ctnnb1 </i> , <i> Gsk3b </i> , and <i> Axin2 </i> ) , Wnt receptors ( e.g. , <i> Lrp8 </i> and <i> Fzd9 </i> ) , or negative regulators of Wnt signaling ( e.g. , <i> Lrp1b </i> and <i> Lrp4 </i> ) .
We then further analyzed the most frequently altered genes <i> ( Apc , Ctnnb1 </i> , and <i> Lrp1b ) </i> in another 46 tumors and found mutations in these three genes in 21 @/@ 66 samples : <i> Apc </i> ( n = 6 ) , <i> Ctnnb1 </i> ( n = 9 ) , and <i> Lrp1b </i> ( n = 6 ) .
Wnt pathway mutations frequently occurred in high @-@ grade dysplasia , suggesting an early requirement during tumorigenesis .
Only missense , nonsense , essential splice site mutations or frameshift @-@ causing indels were observed ( no silent mutations ) , suggesting a strong enrichment for functionally relevant events .
For example , <i> Apc </i> mutations were mostly nonsense or frameshift mutations , whereas <i> Ctnnb1 </i> mutations were recurrent activating mutations at specific positions that have also been described in humans ( e.g. , T141I ) .
Missense mutations in <i> Lrp1b </i> , a negative regulator of Wnt signaling , have been found earlier in <i> Braf </i> mutant human melanoma ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"> Nikolaev et al. , 2012 </xref> ) .
All together , these results provide strong evidence for an important role of Wnt pathway activation during early dysplasia progression .
It is worth noting that in some tumors with strong Wnt target gene expression , no mutations in Wnt pathway genes were found , suggesting additional unidentified mechanisms .
<sec-title level="2"> Large @-@ Scale Drug Screening Identifies Targetable Nodes in Braf @-@ Induced Tumorigenesis </sec-title>
To test the sensitivity of <i> Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup>@ -@ induced intestinal cancer cell lines to Braf inhibition we performed short-term proliferation assays .
Overall , only minor growth inhibition was observed for <i> Braf </i> mutant mouse and human colorectal cancer cell lines treated with 5 μM PLX4720 , a selective inhibitor of mutant Braf ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figures 7 </xref>@ A and 7B ) .
Braf inhibition was proposed to cause feedback activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in human <i> BRAF </i> mutant CRCs ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"> Prahallad et al. , 2012 </xref> ) .
We therefore treated mouse and human <i> BRAF </i> mutant cell lines with the EGFR small molecule kinase inhibitor , Gefitinib , alone or in combination with PLX4720 .
As expected , Gefitinib and PLX4720 synergized in @-@ growth inhibition ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figures 7 </xref>@ A and 7B ) .
The murine intestinal cancer cell line MouseT1 ( from a <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> <i> ; p53 </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ R172H/+ </i> </sup> mouse ) , had similar sensitivity to combinatorial PLX4720 @/@ Gefitinib treatment as HT-29 ( WiDr ) , one of the three human cell lines tested by Prahallad and colleagues ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figures 7 </xref>@ A and 7B ; inhibition of proliferation by 60 % @–@ 70 % ) .
It seems , however , that the effectiveness of PLX4720 @/@ Gefitinib varies considerably among human cancers : in three of five tested human cell lines the effects were rather modest ( growth inhibition by 25 % @–@ 40 % ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref>@ A and data not shown ) .
We next performed long-term ( 14 days ) clonogenic assays and again found that although PLX4720 and Gefitinib synergized in @-@ growth inhibition , most of the treated cell lines retained variable levels of colony @-@ forming capacity ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref>@ C ) .
To identify alternative drugs with effectiveness across cell lines , we performed high @-@ throughput drug screening .
We tested a large set of compounds inhibiting a broad range of molecules , pathways , and biologic processes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref>@ B ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Table S7 </xref> ) .
All compounds were tested alone or in combination with PLX4720 and for each cell line we performed 100 different short-term ( 6 day ) sensitivity assays .
These screens revealed several treatment approaches that were highly effective ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref>@ B ) .
PD0325901 , a Mek inhibitor , was the most effective single compound across cell lines in the short-term assays ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref>@ B ) .
In the long-term clonogenic assay , it induced complete inhibition of colony @-@ forming capacity in five of six cell lines and partial inhibition in the remaining line RKO ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref>@ C ) .
The PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 was not effective as a single agent , but induced potent inhibition in combination with PLX4720 across cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figures 7 </xref>@ B and 7C ) .
Some other drug combinations strongly inhibited selected cell lines , although they were not broadly effective across tumors .
For example , the combination of PLX4720 plus the kinase inhibitor VX-680 was the most potent drug combination for the treatment of RKO , a highly resistant cell line to most other drugs .
This shows the power of systematic drug screening to identify patient @-@ specific treatment approaches even for highly resistant tumors .
Another example is the combination of the Chk1 @/@ Chk2 inhibitor AZD-7762 plus PLX4720 , which was very effective in MouseT1 , HT-29 , LS411N , and COLO-205 and could potentially be a broadly effective alternative first-line or second @-@ line combination .
<sec-title level="2"> In Vivo Validation of Mek and Combinatorial Braf @/@ PI3K Inhibition </sec-title>
To study the effectiveness of broadly effective drug combinations in vivo , we first transplanted mouse and human cell lines subcutaneously ( s.c. ) into immunodeficient Nod Scid IL12R-gamma null ( NSG ) mice and assessed their response to PD0325901 .
Treatment was started 7 @–@ 14 days after s.c. injection of cells as soon as tumors were palpable .
Animals were given PD0325901 or vehicle by oral gavage for 13 @–@ 15 days .
PD0325901 was highly effective , causing regression of tumors from all tested cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7 </xref>@ D ) .
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figures S6 </xref>@ A and S6B show that after 13 @–@ 15 days of PD0325901 treatment there was complete inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in surviving tumor cells and that only very few scattered Ki67 @-@ positive cancer cells could still be observed in the necrotic tumor mass .
We next performed orthotopic transplantation of mouse and human <i> Braf </i> mutant cancer cell lines into the cecum of NSG mice .
Fourteen days later , treatment was started with either vehicle or PD0325901 .
Mice were sacrificed after 17 days of treatment .
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figures S6 </xref>@ C–S6E show that vehicle @-@ treated mice developed large tumors , which metastasized to local lymph nodes and the peritoneum , causing hemorrhagic ascites .
In contrast , in the PD0325901 @-@ treated group , tumors were either not detectable or small ( maximum 0.01 cm @<sup> 3 </sup> ) .
To examine the effect of PD0325901 on proliferation in endogenous Braf @<sup> V637E </sup>@ -@ induced tumors , we performed short-term treatments ( 5 days ) of <i> Vil @-@ Cre ; Braf </i> <sup> <i> LSL @-@ V637E </i>@ /+ </sup> mice .
We used animals that were more than 1 year of age and were expected to have tumors .
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> Figures S6 </xref>@ F and S6G show that Ki67 immunoreactivity was weak in the majority of dysplastic cells in PD0325901 @-@ treated mice but was strong in tumors of vehicle @-@ treated animals .
All together , these data show that Mek inhibition is effective in the treatment of Braf @-@ induced intestinal tumors in vivo .
To examine the effectiveness of combinatorial Braf @/@ PI3K inhibition in vivo we treated s.c. transplanted murine and human cell lines with a combination of PLX4720 and GDC0941 or vehicle .
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figures 7 </xref>@ E , <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app3"> S6 </xref>@ H , and S6I show that combined Braf @/@ PI3K inhibition elicited potent growth inhibition in both models .

These data mirror the in vitro effectiveness of these treatments in vivo .

<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Melanospheres isolated from metastatic melanoma tumors possess stem cell properties , are highly tumorigenic in vivo and recapitulate the patient tumor </sec-title>
Ten patient @-@ derived metastatic melanoma specimens were enzymatically dissociated and tumor cells were cultured in selective conditions for CSC ( tumor spheres ) , as previously described [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"> 41 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"> 44 </xref>@ ] .
Following prolonged culture , we obtained exponentially growing “ melanospheres ” with efficiency of 80 % ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A left ) .
The same cells cultured in conditions specific for the growth of melanocytes generated monolayers of tumor cells whose morphology resembled differentiated cells , suggesting the capacity of melanospheres to differentiate <i> in vitro </i> ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A right ) .
We next investigated the expression of antigens that have been previously associated with MIC .
Melanospheres did not express CD133 , CD20 , CD24 , ABCB5 or CD271 ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1A-B ) , while p-glycoprotein was detectable at low levels .
They expressed stem cell @-@ related markers as c-Kit , Cripto , CD146 , CD44 and CD166 ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1A ) in agreement with previous reports on cell line @-@ derived melanospheres [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"> 38 </xref>@ ] .
Finally , embryonic stem cell markers Nanog and Oct-4 were detected at the RNA level in all samples analyzed ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1C ) .
The CD44 isoform V6 was specifically restricted to melanospheres , being not expressed in differentiated cells , nor in tumor cells freshly isolated from melanosphere @-@ derived xenografts nor in melanocytes ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1D ) .
Melanospheres could be expanded <i> in vitro </i> for several months and their proliferation rate was not lost with time ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2A ) .
They were composed by a large ( mean 42 % ± 8 in all examined samples ) fraction of self @-@ renewing sphere @-@ reforming cells ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2B upper left ) .
Finally , secondary and tertiary spheres were formed with a similar frequency and tertiary spheres were able to proliferate indefinitely , indicating that the fraction of self @-@ renewing cells did not decrease with passages ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2B upper right panel ) .
The clonogenic activity was higher in melanospheres than in their differentiated counterpart ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2B lower panels ) .
Under appropriate conditions , melanospheres generated a progeny of cells with morphology and phenotype of melanocytic , adipogenic or osteogenic cells , demonstrating multiple differentiation ability and recapitulating the plasticity of neural crest cells ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ :Figure S2C ) .
Melanospheres were highly tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously in NOD Scid or Nude mice and all samples displayed tumor take of 100 % down to 25000 cells .
For one sample we performed a limiting dilution experiment and even as low as 5 cells readily generated a tumor within 8 weeks ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B and C ) .
In contrast , melanosphere @-@ derived differentiated cells displayed a decreased and delayed tumor growth <i> in vivo </i> , and as many as 5x10 @<sup> 4 </sup> differentiated cells generated a slowly growing tumor with a 10 @-@ week delay post @-@ injection ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
Immunohistochemical analysis of melanosphere @-@ derived xenografts , performed for all samples , revealed a high similarity between the xenograft and the original patient tumor in terms of morphology and expression of the melanoma @-@ associated diagnostic antigens MART1 and S100 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ D is a representative image ) .
Following xenograft dissociation and re @-@ injection we easily obtained secondary and tertiary tumors , suggesting that tumorigenic potential was not lost with passages in mice , in fact these results proved the ability of tumorigenic cells to self @-@ renew <i> in vivo </i> ( results not shown ) .
Based on these <i> in vitro </i> and <i> in vivo </i> results , we considered melanospheres as surrogate of melanoma @-@ initiating cells ( MIC ) exploitable for pre @-@ clinical experimentation .
<sec-title level="2"> Melanospheres are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs and to most pathway inhibitors </sec-title>
We investigated the response of melaospheres to chemotherapeutic agents currently used in the treatment of melanoma patients .
Melanospheres were exposed to cisplatin , temozolomide , dacarbazine and paclitaxel for 48 hours and cell viability was assessed by MTT assay .
Overall a weak cytotoxic effect ( < 40 % in all samples and with all drugs ) was observed with no therapeutic window as compared to normal melanocytes ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Conversely , differentiated cells were extremely sensitive to cisplatin , in 3 out of 3 samples assessed ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ B is a representative sample ) .
We next investigated the cytotoxic potential of a panel of 80 signaling pathway inhibitors on melanospheres derived from patient #1 and #2 and #3 encompassing inhibitors of RAS @/@ RAF @/@ MEK and PI3K @/@ AKT pathways as well as tyrosine kinase receptors .
Only inhibitors of the RAS @/@ RAF @/@ MEK pathway ( including the MEK inhibitors PD098059 and U0126 and the Erk2 inhibitor 5 @-@ iodotubercidin ) showed promising antitumor activity in terms of reduced cell viability , as measured by MTT assay .
The other drugs , except for the broadly toxic compound staurosporin used as positive control , were nearly unable to reduce cell viability @/@ proliferation , although all compounds were used at doses higher than the described IC @<sub> 50 </sub> in order to enhance their activity .
A similar drug response was observed for the different samples ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ C shows a representative one ) .
In line with the melanosphere sensitivity to compounds targeting the MAPK pathways , we observed the activation of this signaling pathway with high levels of phosphorylation of Erk and downstream S6 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ D ) .
We also found high levels of Cyclin-D and undetectable p16 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ D ) .
These results are in agreement with the frequent alteration of the RAS @/@ RAF @/@ MEK pathway and cell cycle deregulation found in melanomas .
Next , we analyzed DNA sequences of genes whose alterations may contribute to the abnormal pathway activation .
As reported in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref>@ : Table S1 , NRAS was never mutated in the analyzed samples .
Instead , despite the ubiquitous Erk phosphorylation found in melanospheres , the BRAF @-@ V600E mutation was detected in samples 1 , 2 and 4 , BRAF @-@ V600K mutation was found in samples 5 and 8 , while samples 3 , 6 and 7 displayed wild type BRAF .
All samples displayed wild type PTEN .
Finally , sequence analysis of the exon 4 and 5 of GNAQ gene , whose mutations have been associated with wild type BRAF and NRAS melanomas , revealed wild type status in all samples ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref>@ : Table S1 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4"> 4 </xref> ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"> 45 </xref>@ ] .
<sec-title level="2"> Treatment with MEK inhibitor PD0325901 results in strong antitumor activity against melanospheres </sec-title>
The encouraging activity of the MEK inhibitors used in the pathway inhibitor screening ( see above ) prompted us to study the antitumor effect of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 on the melanospheres , based on its antitumor activity described in clinical studies [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref>@ ] .
Following 3 day @-@ exposure to PD0325901 , at doses comparable with those achieved <i> in vivo , </i> both wild type and mutated @-@ BRAF cells displayed decreased proliferation @/@ viability , with mutated @-@ BRAF samples being more sensitive to the drug ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A ) .
In order to distinguish the cytostatic from the cytotoxic effect and to unravel the molecular mechanisms of PD0325901 antitumor activity against malenospheres , we first performed cell cycle analysis of control and treated samples .
After short exposure ( 2 days ) , PD0325901 greatly affected cell cycle progression by determining accumulation of cells in the G1 phase , both in the wild type and mutated @-@ BRAF samples ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
At the molecular level , together with a striking decrease in Cyclin D levels which is in line with the observed cell cycle arrest , treated samples displayed a decline in Erk and S6 phosphorylation , thus , proving MEK signaling inhibition by PD0325901 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ C ) .
Given that PD0325901 may induce apoptosis in melanoma cell lines , we investigated whether a similar mechanism could account for the reduced number of viable cells in PD0325901 @-@ treated melanosphere samples [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"> 17 </xref>@ ] .
Indeed , PD0325901 @-@ treated mutant @-@ BRAF melanospheres contained a high fraction of apoptotic annexin V @-@ positive cells compared to control samples .
In contrast , PD0325901 treated wild type @-@ BRAF melanospheres did not show such a dramatic increase ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ D ) .
Importantly , we found that both wild type and mutated @-@ BRAF melanoma differentiated cells , were exquisitely sensitive to the drug , as indicated by the high fraction of sub @-@ diploid cells detected in treated samples stained with Propidium Iodide ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ E ) .
This additional apoptosis assay confirmed that , at the level of melanospheres , only mutated @-@ BRAF cells rapidly underwent PD0325901 @-@ induced apoptosis , while apoptotic hypodiploid DNA @-@ cells were almost absent in the treated wild type @-@ BRAF cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ E ) .
These results indicate that PD0325901 exerted strong cytotoxic activity against mutant @-@ BRAF melanospheres , and a strong cytostatic activity against wild type @-@ BRAF melanospheres , where cytotoxicity played a minor role .
In contrast , differentiated melanoma cells were efficiently killed by PD0325901 , regardless BRAF status ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ E ) .
<sec-title level="2"> Treatment with MEK inhibitor PD0325901 results in strong antitumor activity in melanosphere @-@ derived xenografts </sec-title>
We investigated the activity of PD0325901 against melanosphere @-@ generated subcutaneous xenografts .
Doses of 25 or 12.5 mg @/@ Kg were investigated in order to define a well tolerated dose with reduced toxicity and maximum antitumor activity , as the optimal doses and schedules for antitumor activity in the absence of toxicity was not previously determined in cancer patients .
We chose the bi @-@ weekly treatment schedule for drug administration based on previously published results showing high systemic toxicity occurring during daily drug administration [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"> 46 </xref>@ ] and as we previously experienced similar results in mice ( results not shown ) .
PD0325901 administration , by oral gavage , caused a striking reduction in tumor growth at both drug doses , displaying stronger activity for the higher dose ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ A and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5"> 5 </xref>@ : Figure S3A ) .
Importantly , treated mice did not exhibit signs of toxicity under this treatment schedule .
Immunoblot analysis of xenografts displayed markedly reduced levels of Erk and downstream S6 phosphorylation in treated tumors , indicating that PD0325901 levels reached <i> in vivo </i> were sufficient to achieve almost complete Erk inactivation and that the effects observed on tumors were caused by specific PD0325901 activity ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5"> 5 </xref>@ : Figure S3B ) .
Immunohistochemistry analysis of xenografts revealed decreased proliferation rates for treated tumors ( lower Ki-67 expression in comparison with control tumors ) and reduced activation of the Mek @/@ Erk pathway ( lower Erk phosphorylation ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ B ) .
In addition , staining with murine CD34 antibody demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect of PD0325901 on tumor vascularization , as control tumors contained large vessels , while treated tumors displayed drastically compromised vasculature composed by minuscule vessels ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ B ) .
A decrease of tumor vascularization appeared also by macroscopic observation of the tumors ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5"> 5 </xref>@ : Figure S3A ) .
Importantly , similar results were obtained when xenografts were generated by wild type @-@ BRAF melanospheres indicating that this strategy might constitute a potentially exploitable therapeutic approach both for mutated @-@ BRAF and wild type @-@ BRAF melanoma patients ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ C and D ) .
Immunoblot analysis showed that VEGF levels were lower in treated @-@ melanospheres ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ E ) and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that PD0325901 @-@ treated xenografts expressed reduced levels of VEGF in comparison with control tumors ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ F ) .
These results were obtained both for mutated BRAF and wild type BRAF melanospheres and xenografts and suggest that Mek inhibition might determine , together with a direct cytotoxic @/@ cytostatic effect on tumor cells , a reduction of the tumor cell @-@ dependent pro @-@ angiogenic activity <i> in vivo . </i>

<sec-title level="2"> Expression and localization of PHB in pancreatic cancer cells and tissue </sec-title>
To investigate the role of PHB in pancreatic cancer cells , we first chose two human pancreatic cancer cell lines , AsPC-1 ( high malignancy ) and Capan-2 ( low malignancy ) .
Interestingly , AsPC-1 cells grew as single cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A , left ) , whereas Capan-2 cells exhibited tiny islands of densely packed cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A , right ) .
Additionally , AsPC-1 cells exhibited much higher growth and migration capacities than those of Capan-2 cells ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1A , B ) .
RT-PCR showed a difference in PHB mRNA expression levels , revealing higher expression in AsPC-1 cells than that in Capan-2 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S2A ) .
In agreement with RT-PCR data , immunoblot analysis also demonstrated high expression of PHB protein in AsPC-1 cells , but little expression in Capan-2 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ C and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S2B ) .
Intriguingly , localization of PHB in AsPC-1 cells was mainly in the plasma membrane and cytosol , whereas its localization was in Capan-2 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ D , E ) .
This result indicated that the observed phenotypes may correlate with the expression and localization of PHB protein .
Therefore , AsPC-1 cells were chosen to investigate the biological properties of PHB in pancreatic cancer both <i> in vitro </i> and <i> in vivo </i>@ .
We next assessed PHB expression in pancreatic tissue .
PHB protein was weakly expressed in 63.6 % of normal pancreas samples ( n = 11 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ F , G ) .
However , PHB protein was strongly expressed in 58.7 % of PDAC samples ( n = 46 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ F , G and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S3 ) .
Taken together , these results show that PHB , which becomes more pronounced with pancreatic cancer malignancy , may serve as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer .

Intriguingly , the phosphorylation status of ERK2 was much higher than that of ERK1 in AsPC-1 cells , and this phenomenon was completely converse in Capan-2 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
This observation suggests distinct roles of ERK1 and ERK2 in the regulation of cell behavior in AsPC-1 and Capan-2 cells .
To test whether PHB is required for the ERK pathway , we validated a siRNA against PHB ( siPHB ) in AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells by quantitative real-time PCR .
The results showed that siPHB reduced the PHB mRNA level by about 80 % compared with that using control siRNA ( siCon ) ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S4A , B ) .
Furthermore , we checked the phosphorylation status of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in siPHB @-@ transfected AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells .
As expected , stimulation of AsPC-1 cells with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) caused an increase of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ B , C ) , whereas silencing of PHB expression strongly suppressed the EGF @-@ induced phosphorylation of ERK ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ B , C ) .
This finding suggested specific involvement of PHB in the RAS @-@ RAF @-@ ERK pathway .
Moreover , a similar result was obtained in Panc-1 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ B ) , indicating general inhibition of ERK activation by PHB depletion .
Thus , these results clearly indicate that PHB is required for EGF @-@ induced ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in pancreatic cancer cells .
<sec-title level="2"> RocA disrupts the ERK pathway by targeting the CRAF @-@ PHB interaction in AsPC-1 cells </sec-title>
The oncogenic RAS @-@ ERK pathway is a key node for cellular proliferation signals and has been the focus of substantial drug discovery efforts in many cancers [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref>@ ] .
A previous study has indicated that RocA suppresses the ERK pathway in leukemic cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
To confirm that the anti @-@ tumor effect of RocA is indeed caused by suppression of the ERK pathway , we examined the effect of RocA on ERK activity in AsPC-1 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ E ) .
The results showed significant dose @-@ dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation status of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
Importantly , RocA showed very strong time @-@ dependent suppression of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activities ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
PHB was previously shown to be required for membrane association and activation of CRAF [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , we examined whether RocA affects PHB @-@ CRAF membrane association in AsPC-1 cells .
To this end , cell membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared from AsPC-1 cells treated with Roc-A or DMSO to analyze the localization of PHB and CRAF .
Immunoblot analysis showed significant reduction of CRAF , particularly phosphorylated CRAF ( pSer338 ) , in the membrane fraction after RocA treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ C ) .
Notably , RocA also significantly reduced the levels of PHB in the membrane fraction , indicating that binding of RocA to PHB may also interfere with PHB membrane association .
However , RocA did not influence membrane localization of RAS ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ C ) .
Indeed , immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that RocA substantially decreased the amounts of total CRAF bound to PHB in AsPC-1 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ D ) .
Notably , confocal microscopic analysis showed that treatment of AsPC-1 cells with 100 nM RocA for 4 h led to a loss of plasma membrane localization and random redistribution of PHB ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ E ) .
This observation indicates that inhibition of the PHB @-@ CRAF interaction by RocA leads to the loss of spatial organization of PHB in AsPC-1 cells .
Collectively , these results further demonstrate that RocA blocks the RAS @-@ CRAF @-@ ERK signaling pathway by disruption of the PHB @-@ CRAF interaction in pancreatic cancer .
<sec-title level="2"> RocA mimics the effect of PHB knockdown on epithelial @-@ mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) markers and reverses the EMT phenotype in AsPC-1 cells </sec-title>
The oncogenic RAS @-@ RAF @-@ ERK pathway confers epithelial cells with critical motile and invasive capacities during carcinoma progression , often by promotion of EMT [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref>@ ] .
To further investigate the role of PHB in EMT , the effects of PHB siRNA and RocA on EMT markers were assayed in AsPC-1 cells .
First , we detected EMT markers in AsPC-1 and Capan-2 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ A ) .
Knockdown of PHB in AsPC-1 cells by siRNA resulted in upregulation of E-cadherin and β-catenin and downregulation of vimentin ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ B ) .
Similar to the effect of PHB knockdown , treatment of AsPC-1 cells with RocA showed the same results ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ C ) .
Activated ERK2 directly phosphorylates Snail , leading to nuclear accumulation , reduced ubiquitylation , and an increased protein half-life of Snail , and then promotion of breast cancer cell invasion and migration <i> in vitro </i> and metastasis <i> in vivo </i>@ [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] .
Another study has shown clear increases of ZEB1 and ZEB2 protein levels by ERK2 but not ERK1 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref>@ ] .
To further investigate the molecular basis of ERK @-@ regulated EMT , we detected the levels of Snail1 , ZEB1 , and transcription factors known to regulate EMT which act downstream of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
Interestingly , we observed similar results in PHB @-@ silenced and RocA @-@ treated AsPC-1 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ B , C ) .
AsPC-1 cells lacking PHB expression showed defective migration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ D ) , indicating that the formation of clusters is the consequence of reduced motility of cells that lack high levels of PHB .
Notably , AsPC-1 cells treated with RocA formed cell clusters similar to those formed by cells with reduced PHB expression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ D ) .
Taken together , RocA mimics the effect of PHB knockdown on EMT marker expression and reverses the EMT phenotype in AsPC-1 cells .
<sec-title level="2"> RocA selectively diminishes the viability of PHB @-@ dependent pancreatic cancer cells <i> in vitro </i> and inhibits their migration <i> in vitro </i> and <i> in vivo </i> </sec-title>
To characterize the action of RocA on pancreatic cancer cell growth , AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells were treated with RocA ( 100 nM ) or DMSO for 16 h and then applied to CCK-8 assays .
RocA markedly impaired the growth of AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells without affecting Hs 578Bst or L02 cells as controls ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ A , B ) .
Interestingly , Capan-2 cells did not show any detectable toxicity in the presence of RocA ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S5 ) , suggesting deficient expression of PHB in Capan-2 cells may rescue the effects of RocA .
Additionally , RocA impaired the migration of AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ C ) .
To investigate the effect of RocA on metastasis , we established an orthotopic xenograft model in mice using AsPC-1 cells .
At 1 week after orthotopic implantation of AsPC-1 cells into severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID ) mice , RocA ( 5 mg @/@ kg body weight ) was administrated via intraperitoneal injection daily for 3 weeks .
As a result , treatment with RocA significantly suppressed cancer metastasis to the lung and liver in mice ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ D ) .
Histological analysis of the lung and liver revealed that dissemination of cancer cells was absent in tissue sections from RocA @-@ treated mice , but an abundance of cancer cells were observed in vehicle @-@ treated mice ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ D ) .
Comparison of the survival curve of RocA @-@ treated mice with that of vehicle @-@ treated mice showed that RocA treatment significantly prolonged the survival of tumor @-@ bearing mice ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S6A , B ) .
Taken together , RocA impairs the migration of pancreatic cancer cells <i> in vitro </i> and <i> in vivo </i>@ .
<sec-title level="2"> RocA suppresses <i> in vivo </i> growth of tumor xenografts </sec-title>
To further evaluate the anti @-@ tumor activity of RocA , we administered RocA to SCID mice bearing subcutaneous AsPC-1 tumor cell xenografts and monitored the tumor growth rate .
RocA was administrated by intraperitoneal injection once per day .
As a result , RocA significantly suppressed tumor growth compared with that in the control group .
Tumor volumes in the RocA @-@ treated group were 37 ± 8 % of those in the control group ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ A , B ) .
Intriguingly , RocA treatment neither caused any loss of body weight nor exhibited apparent signs of toxicity in mice during the treatments ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ C ) , suggesting that RocA is generally well tolerated <i> in vivo </i>@ .
Moreover , although RocA @-@ treated mice eventually died from the pancreatic tumors , treatment with RocA significantly extended their lifespan compared with that of vehicle treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ D , E ) .
Next , we investigated the effect of RocA on cell proliferation <i> in vivo </i> by hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) staining and examining Ki-67 and cyclin D1 expression in tumor tissues harvested from vehicle @- and RocA @-@ treated mice .
H&E staining showed a compact mass of epithelial cells in vehicle @-@ treated mice , whereas RocA @-@ treated tumors exhibited loose epithelial cell aggregates with a higher number of interspersed mesenchymal cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ F , left ) .
In addition , RocA treatment resulted in a 3.2 @-@ fold decrease of Ki-67 @-@ positive cells in tumor sections from RocA @-@ treated mice compared with that in vehicle @-@ treated mice ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ F , middle and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ G , upper ) .

Therefore , RocA is a potent small molecule that suppresses the growth of AsPC-1 cell @-@ derived tumors <i> in vivo </i>@ .
Prostate cancer ETS rearrangements switch a cell migration gene expression program from RAS @/@ ERK to PI3K @/@ AKT regulation ( PMID : 24642271 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
We find that oncogenic ETS expression negatively correlates with <i> RAS </i> and <i> RAF </i> mutations in prostate tumors .
Furthermore , the oncogenic ETS transcription factors only increased cell migration in the absence of RAS @/@ ERK activation .
In contrast to RAS @/@ ERK , it has been reported that oncogenic ETS expression positively correlates with PI3K @/@ AKT activation .
We identified a mechanistic explanation for this finding by showing that oncogenic ETS proteins required AKT signaling to activate a cell migration gene expression program through ETS @/@ AP-1 binding sequences .
Levels of pAKT correlated with the ability of oncogenic ETS proteins to increase cell migration , but this process did not require mTORC1 .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
<sec-title level="2"> Oncogenic ETS gene rearrangement occurs in tumors lacking RAS @/@ ERK mutations </sec-title>
If oncogenic ETS gene rearrangements replace RAS @/@ ERK activation , we predict that RAS @/@ ERK mutations will occur only in ETS rearrangement negative tumors .
To test this hypothesis , we examined the results of three recently published studies [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"> 6 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref>@ ] that both sequence exons and identify chromosome rearrangements in prostate tumors ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Together these studies examine 266 prostate tumors .
One @-@ half ( 133 ) have ERG or ETV1 chromosome rearrangements .
We searched for either gene fusions , or point mutations in canonical RAS @/@ ERK pathway genes ( RAS , RAF , MEK , and ERK encoding genes ) .
Eight tumors had such aberrations , and all eight were negative for oncogenic ETS rearrangements .
This indicates that , while genomic alterations in RAS @/@ ERK pathway components are rare in prostate cancer , there is a statistically significant ( P = 0.007 ; Fisher ’s exact test ) mutual exclusivity of these alterations and ETS rearrangements .
It has been previously reported that PI3K @/@ AKT activation via PTEN deletion positively correlates with ETS gene rearrangements [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] .
A search for PTEN loss in these 266 tumors ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) confirms these findings and indicates that PTEN loss is more than twice as likely in tumors with ETS gene rearrangements than in those without ( P = 0.0008 ; Fisher ’s exact test ) .
In conclusion , <i> ERG </i> and <i> ETV1 </i> gene rearrangements positively correlate with PTEN loss and negatively correlate with RAS @/@ ERK mutations in tumors .
<sec-title level="2"> Prostate cancer cell lines as models of oncogenic ETS function </sec-title>
To test the effect of RAS @/@ ERK signaling and PI3K @/@ AKT signaling on oncogenic ETS function in prostate cell lines , we must first determine which cell lines have these characteristics .
Although some prostate cancer cell lines , such as VCaP ( <i> ERG </i> ) and LNCaP ( <i> ETV1 </i> ) are reported to have oncogenic ETS gene rearrangements [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"> 11 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref>@ ] , the full extent of oncogenic ETS protein expression , including fusion @-@ independent expression , in commonly used prostate cancer cell lines has not been determined .
To identify the expression level of the four oncogenic ETS proteins , we first tested available antibodies using purified recombinant proteins ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .
We identified antibodies to ERG , ETV1 , ETV4 , and ETV5 that could detect each protein at femtomolar levels .
Because ETV1 , ETV4 , and ETV5 are homologous proteins , the sensitivity and specificity of these antibodies were compared .
ETV1 and ETV4 antibodies were specific , but the ETV5 antibody recognized ETV4 and ETV5 equally .
We then examined oncogenic ETS protein levels , along with phosphorylated ERK ( pERK : RAS @/@ ERK pathway ) and phosphorylated AKT ( pAKT : PI3K @/@ AKT pathway ) levels in six prostate cancer cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1A ) .
DU145 cells , which have a KRAS gene rearrangement [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref>@ ] , did not have high levels of any oncogenic ETS protein , or pAKT , but did have pERK , consistent with the small fraction of prostate cancers with RAS @/@ ERK pathway mutations ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Of the remaining five prostate cancer cell lines , four had high expression of a single oncogenic protein .
These included ERG in VCaP , consistent with a <i> TMRPSS2 @/@ ERG </i> rearrangement [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"> 11 </xref>@ ] , ETV1 in MDA @-@ PCa-2B , consistent with an <i> ETV1 </i> gene rearrangement [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref>@ ] , and ETV4 in PC3 , consistent with high <i> ETV4 </i> mRNA [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] .
ETV4 protein was also present at high levels in CWR22Rv1 .
Of the four lines with high oncogenic ETS protein expression , all had high levels of pAKT , but only one ( CWR22Rv1 ) had high levels of pERK , consistent with the analysis of prostate tumors in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref>@ .
Surprisingly , despite an ETV1 gene rearrangement [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref>@ ] , and high ETV1 mRNA levels [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] , ETV1 protein was not observed in LNCaP cells .
However , this is consistent with results from Vitari <i> et al. </i> who showed low ETV1 protein levels in LNCaP cells due to proteasomal targeting by the COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref>@ ] .
Long exposures could identify pERK , pAKT , and some ETS proteins at low levels in immunoblots from most cell lines .
To more quantitatively establish the “ high @-@ level ” threshold shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B , ETS proteins in cell extracts were compared with purified standards ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1B ) .
All “ high @-@ level ” expression for ETS proteins exceeded 50,000 proteins per cell , and was highest at 330,000 proteins per cell for ERG in VCaP .
Low @-@ level ETS expression was 10,000 proteins per cell ( ETV4 in DU145 ) or less ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1B and data not shown ) .
It is possible that oncogenic ETS expression and signaling pathway activation could influence each other .
To test this , RWPE-1 ( RWPE ) cells derived from normal prostate [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref>@ ] or variations of this line that express either Ki-RAS ( RWPE @-@ KRAS , also known as RWPE-2 ) or ERG ( RWPE @-@ ERG ) were compared .
ERG levels in RWPE @-@ ERG cells were similar to VCaP cells ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref>@ : Figure S1C ) .
None of the oncogenic ETS were expressed at high levels in RWPE or RWPE @-@ KRAS cells , and only ERG was expressed in RWPE @-@ ERG cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
As expected , KRAS increased both pERK and pAKT levels ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
Interestingly , over-expression of ERG also resulted in activation of AKT and a small increase in pERK ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
In other cell types , the RAS @/@ ERK pathway activates ETV1 , ETV4 , and ETV5 expression [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref>@ ] .
Therefore , high ETV4 expression in CWR22Rv1 cells could be the result of ERK activation .
To test this , CWR22Rv1 and DU145 cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126 for 24 hours .
In both cell lines , U0126 decreased pERK levels , but did not alter levels of ETV4 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ C ) .
Therefore , RAS @/@ ERK activation does not drive oncogenic ETS expression in prostate cancer cell lines , however in at least one context ( ERG in RWPE ) an oncogenic ETS could induce the phosphorylation of both AKT and , to a lesser degree , ERK .
<sec-title level="2"> Oncogenic ETS proteins and KRAS drive prostate cell migration , but not synergistically </sec-title>
We next tested the role of signaling pathways in the ability of oncogenic ETS proteins to drive cell migration .
Because cancer derived cell lines have many mutations and copy number alterations that affect cellular phenotypes , we used the RWPE @-@ ERG and RWPE @-@ KRAS cell lines to compare the ability of oncogenic ETS and RAS signaling to promote cell migration in the same cellular background .
RWPE @-@ ERG and RWPE @-@ KRAS cells migrated 5 @- and 10 @-@ fold more than RWPE cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) , indicating that both ERG and KRAS induce cell migration .
Similar to our previous findings [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref>@ ] , overexpression of oncogenic ETS proteins ETV1 , ETV5 , and ERG , but not other ETS proteins ( FLI1 and SPDEF ) , promoted RWPE cell migration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ B and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) .
In contrast , when the same ETS proteins were over-expressed in RWPE @-@ KRAS cells , none of the oncogenic ETS proteins induced additional cell migration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ C and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) , suggesting that these ETS proteins and KRAS were functioning to activate the same pathway .
These findings are consistent with our model that oncogenic ETS proteins can mimic RAS activation in cell lines lacking RAS activity , and are distinct from ETS proteins expressed in normal prostate .
<sec-title level="2"> A role for the PI3K @/@ AKT pathway in oncogenic ETS function </sec-title>
To identify signaling pathways required for the oncogenic function of ETS factors , a microarray analysis of <i> ETV4 </i> knockdown in PC3 prostate cancer cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] was compared to the Connectivity Map database [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"> 29 </xref>@ ] that contains microarray data of PC3 cells treated with 1309 small molecules , including many signaling pathway inhibitors .
Similarities between the gene expression profile of a signaling pathway inhibitor and <i> ETV4 </i> knockdown would predict a role for that pathway in oncogenic ETS function .
The top two , and three of the top five small molecules that induced gene expression changes most similar to <i> ETV4 </i> knockdown were inhibitors of either PI3K or mTOR , a downstream effector of PI3K ( Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> ) .
These data suggest that in PC3 cells , PI3K and ETV4 activate a similar gene expression program .
To test if the PI3K pathway is required for an oncogenic ETS protein to promote the cell migration phenotype , RWPE @-@ ERG and RWPE @-@ KRAS cells were treated with the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 .
LY294002 reduced AKT phosphorylation in both lines , consistent with PI3K inhibition ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A ) .
Strikingly , PI3K inhibition completely abrogated cell migration induced by ERG , but not cell migration induced by KRAS ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) .
In fact RWPE @-@ KRAS cells actually migrated more when PI3K was inhibited .
This increased migration may be due to relief of RAF inhibition by AKT [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"> 9 </xref>@ ] , as RWPE @-@ KRAS cells had higher pMEK levels after treatment by LY294002 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A ) .
To confirm the role of PI3K , a second PI3K inhibitor , ZSTK474 , was also tested ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
Like LY294002 , ZSTK474 significantly reduced migration of RWPE @-@ ERG cells , but not RWPE @-@ KRAS cells .
Cell migration induced by other oncogenic ETS factors , ETV1 , and ETV5 , was also abrogated by PI3K inhibition ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ C and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) .
A second cell migration assay , the scratch assay , confirmed that PI3K inhibition reduced migration caused by ERG expression , but not migration caused by KRAS ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ D and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figure S3 ) .
An AKT inhibitor had a similar effect ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ D and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figure S3 ) , indicating that PI3K is functioning via AKT activation .
These results indicate that overexpression of an oncogenic ETS gene can switch the control of prostate cell migration from the RAS @/@ ERK pathway to the PI3K @/@ AKT pathway .
We next tested if the PI3K pathway was regulating the ability of ERG to activate the transcription of RAS @- and ERG @-@ responsive target genes near enhancers that are co @-@ occupied by ETS and AP-1 proteins .
The expression levels of two such genes , <i> ARHGAP29 </i> , and <i> SMAD3 , </i> were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT @-@ PCR ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ A and B ) .
Both <i> ARHGAP29 </i> and <i> SMAD3 </i> have roles in cell migration and @/@ or cell morphology [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"> 31 </xref>@ ] , are direct targets of oncogenic ETS proteins and AP-1 by ChIP @-@ seq [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref>@ ] , and are activated by KRAS and oncogenic ETS expression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ A and B ) .
Similar to the cell migration phenotype , the activation of both genes was significantly attenuated by PI3K inhibition in RWPE @-@ ERG cells , but not in RWPE @-@ KRAS cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ A and B ) .
Therefore cell migration changes are consistent with changes in the expression of these two oncogenic ETS target genes .
These results indicate that the PI3K @/@ AKT pathway functions through ERG to regulate expression of cell migration genes .
We next used a reporter assay to test if these gene expression changes were mediated by the ETS @/@ AP-1 binding sequences we found in the enhancers of oncogenic ETS target genes .
Three copies of an ETS @/@ AP-1 consensus sequence were cloned upstream of a minimal promoter driving firefly luciferase .
Luciferase expression from this vector was higher when the ERK pathway was active , indicating that this pathway regulates the reporter construct ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ C ) .
Point mutations in either the ETS or AP-1 binding sequences completely eliminated luciferase expression indicating that both binding sites are required for activity ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ C ) .
The PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 , caused a significant decrease in the activity of this reporter in RWPE @-@ ERG cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ D ) , but significantly increased activity in RWPE @-@ KRAS cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ E ) , consistent with the cell migration findings .
Therefore , the PI3K pathway can alter the expression of cell migration genes via ETS @/@ AP-1 sites .
<sec-title level="2"> The role of AKT in oncogenic ETS function is not via mTORC1 </sec-title>
PI3K @/@ AKT signaling has a number of cellular functions including the activation of the mTOR @-@ containing complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref>@ ] .
mTORC1 includes the Raptor protein and regulates gene expression via translational control .
mTORC2 includes the Rictor protein and provides positive feedback by phosphorylating and activating AKT .
To test the role of mTOR @-@ containing complexes in oncogenic ETS function , shRNAs were used to knockdown mTOR , Raptor , and Rictor , in RWPE @-@ ERG cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ A ) .
Loss of Raptor resulted in an increase in cell migration , indicating that mTORC1 is not required for the ability of PI3K @/@ AKT to promote cell migration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ B and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) .
Loss of mTOR had little effect on RWPE @-@ ERG migration , while loss of Rictor decreased migration ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ B and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S2 ) .
Because the major role of the Rictor @-@ containing mTORC2 complex is thought to be the phosphorylation of AKT , we hypothesized that these results were due to changes in AKT phosphorylation .
Consistent with previous findings [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"> 32 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref>@ ] , Raptor knockdown increased AKT phosphorylation , and Rictor knockdown decreased AKT phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ C ) .
Therefore , the effect of mTOR containing complexes on RWPE @-@ ERG cell migration can be explained indirectly by changes to pAKT levels , rather than by a direct role .

Ras proteins play a major role in human cancers but have not yielded to therapeutic attack .
Ras @-@ driven cancers are among the most difficult to treat and often excluded from therapies .
The Ras proteins have been termed “ undruggable , ” based on failures from an era in which understanding of signaling transduction , feedback loops , redundancy , tumor heterogeneity , and Ras ’ oncogenic role was poor .
Structures of Ras oncoproteins bound to their effectors or regulators are unsolved , and it is unknown precisely how Ras proteins activate their downstream targets .
These knowledge gaps have impaired development of therapeutic strategies .
A better understanding of Ras biology and biochemistry , coupled with new ways of targeting undruggable proteins , is likely to lead to new ways of defeating Ras @-@ driven cancers .
Main Text
Fifty years have passed since the transforming power of Ras genes was first recognized .
Harvey sarcoma virus , Kirsten sarcoma virus , and Rasheed sarcoma virus contain Ras genes ( so named for their role in forming <i> ra </i>@ t <i> s </i>@ arcomas ; reviewed in <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0010" refid="bib3 bib31"> Barbacid , 1987 ; Karnoub and Weinberg , 2008 </ce:cross-refs> ) .
These retroviruses initiated tumors efficiently and , using temperature @-@ sensitive mutants , were shown to be necessary for tumor maintenance ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0040" refid="bib62"> Shih et al. , 1979 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
They formed part of a fascinating collection of retroviruses that was assembled in the 1970 s , each able to transform cells in culture and in avian and rodent models .
These experiments were , essentially , unbiased screens for genes that cause cancer ; the nature of the proteins that the genes encoded was completely unknown .
Remarkably , the majority of these viruses encoded proteins that were later identified as components of the tyrosine kinase @-@ Ras signaling pathway ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0045" refid="bib75"> Vogt , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ) , even though the biochemical nature of these proteins was unknown , and tyrosine kinase activity had not been discovered ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0050" refid="bib17"> Eckhart et al. , 1979 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Of the hundreds of mutant proteins now known to contribute to cancer that could have been identified in these assays , including those involved in DNA repair , cellular metabolism , RNA splicing , and the other hallmarks of cancer ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0055" refid="bib25"> Hanahan and Weinberg , 2011 </ce:cross-ref> ) , those in the tyrosine kinase @-@ Ras pathway stand out as the major drivers and have been the richest source of targets of successful cancer therapies ( Abl , epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] , Her2 @/@ neu , B-Raf , Kit , ALK , etc. ) .
These successes can therefore be attributed to the central , dominant role of this pathway in cancer , as well as the fortuitous abundance of druggable targets .
However , specific therapies have not been developed for mutant Ras proteins themselves or for the cancers that they drive .
Worse yet , tumors driven by Ras genes are excluded from treatment with other targeted therapies .
Early efforts to block Ras cancers by preventing Ras farnesylation , once thought to be an essential posttranslational modification for Ras activity , were thwarted by the unexpected presence of a backup system ( geranylgeranyltransferase ) that restored activity of K-Ras and N-Ras after farnesyltransferase treatment .
Likewise , efforts to kill Ras cancers by blocking one of Ras ’ major downstream effectors , Raf kinase ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0060" refid="fig1"> Figure 1 </ce:cross-ref> <ce:float-anchor refid="fig1" /> ) , ran into the unexpected discovery that , in Ras @-@ transformed cells , Raf inhibitors activate the pathway rather than inhibit it ( see below and discussion in <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0065" refid="bib27"> Holderfield et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> and <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0070" refid="bib39"> Lito et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
MAP kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitors and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors have not yet shown significant clinical activity in Ras cancers , for reasons relating to feedback loops and poor therapeutic windows , among other issues discussed below .
A convergence of urgent unmet clinical needs and advances in drug discovery has energized new efforts to target Ras cancers within academic centers and in the biopharmaceutical industry .
To catalyze these renewed efforts , the National Cancer Institute recently launched a national Ras program at Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer ( see <ce:inter-ref> http://webdefence.global.blackspider.com/urlwrap/?q=AXicY2Rn8FrCwHB9AQNDUU6liXmKXnFRmV5uYmZOcn5eSVF-jl5yfi5DiaGJuaeHSY6Bgam5mRFDUlJiSmJRYqlDcQpEPqOkpMBKXz8osdg5FagrMUcvvyidAQIA65QdsA&Z </ce:inter-ref> ) , whose goal is to fill critical knowledge gaps that are essential to target Ras cancers effectively and to engage the research community toward solving the Ras problem .
Here , we will discuss some of these knowledge gaps , as well as recent advances and the challenges that lie ahead .
Ras Mutations in Cancer
Ras genes were the first oncogenes identified in human cancer cells .
In a series of classic experiments , the groups of Weinberg , Cooper , Barbacid , and Wigler independently identified the transforming genes from T24 @/@ EJ bladder carcinoma cells as H-Ras ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0015" refid="bib15 bib50 bib58 bib69"> Der et al. , 1982 ; Parada et al. , 1982 ; Santos et al. , 1982 ; Taparowsky et al. , 1982 </ce:cross-refs> ) .
More than 30 years later , Ras genes are well established as the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0075" refid="tbl1"> Table 1 </ce:cross-ref> <ce:float-anchor refid="tbl1" /> ) , though H-Ras itself is rarely one of them .
Although these numbers are , by now , painfully familiar , they underscore major gaps in our knowledge of Ras biology .
Most obviously , we do not understand why K-Ras mutation is much more frequent in human cancer than N-Ras or H-Ras , even though each of these is a powerful transforming gene in model systems , and all forms are expressed widely in adult tissues and in tumors .
A simple explanation for the high frequency of K-Ras mutations , relative to H-Ras and N-Ras , is that the K-Ras protein has unique properties that favor oncogenesis .
At first sight , this seems unlikely because the Ras proteins are highly conserved , especially in their effector @-@ binding regions where they are actually identical .
However , K-Ras , but not N-Ras or H-Ras , confers stem @-@ like properties on certain cell types ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0080" refid="bib54"> Quinlan and Settleman , 2009 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
K-Ras-4B , the most highly expressed splice variant of K-Ras , binds calmodulin ; H-Ras and N @- Ras do not ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0085" refid="bib74"> Villalonga et al. , 2001 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
We believe that this unique property of K-Ras-4B confers stem @-@ like properties to cells expressing oncogenic K-Ras-4B proteins ( M. Wang and F.M. , unpublished data ) .
Analysis of human syndromes caused by germline mutations in H-Ras or K-Ras supports the idea that K-Ras is a stronger oncogene .
Unexpectedly , humans can tolerate germline @-@ activating mutations in H-Ras @—@ the same activating mutations that drive somatic mutations .
Costello syndrome , which is characterized by germline H-Ras mutations , is associated with a broad spectrum of developmental abnormalities and a high risk for rhabdomyosarcomas and neuroblastomas ( reviewed in <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0090" refid="bib55"> Rauen , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
It is puzzling that these individuals do not succumb to malignancies associated with sporadic H-Ras mutations ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0095" refid="tbl1"> Table 1 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Although fully activating alleles of H-Ras can be tolerated , fully activated alleles of K-Ras may not .
Variant alleles of K-Ras that account for a small fraction of Noonan ’s syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome are weakly activated relative to their sporadic oncogenic counterparts ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0100" refid="bib61"> Schubbert et al. , 2007 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Further support for the idea that K-Ras has functions distinct from H-Ras and N-Ras comes from analyses of the roles of Ras genes in development .
Mice that lack K-Ras die during embryogenesis , whereas mice lacking H-Ras and @/@ or N-Ras are viable ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0105" refid="bib30"> Johnson et al. , 1997 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
However , replacing K-Ras with H-Ras at the K-Ras genomic locus allows mice to develop , suggesting that differential regulation of K-Ras and H-Ras gene expression determines their relative importance in development rather than the properties of the proteins themselves ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0110" refid="bib51"> Potenza et al. , 2005 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Furthermore , Balmain and colleagues discovered that these H-Ras knock @-@ in mice develop tumors in response to carcinogens at normal frequencies , except that they are now driven by H-Ras instead of K-Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0115" refid="bib70"> To et al. , 2008 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
These data argue strongly that the locus is critical and that the specific Ras paralog encoded at that locus does not affect the frequency at which tumors arise .
Equally important , they find that K-Ras-4A , not K-Ras-4B , is necessary for lung tumor initiation , although K-Ras-4B is much more highly expressed during progression .
This supports the idea that K-Ras-4B is the more important target in established tumors but raises the concern that K-Ras-4A may have an important role in minor stem @-@ like populations of established tumors .
These findings point toward an urgent need to validate K-Ras-4A and K-Ras-4B as drug targets , a major issue that has not yet been addressed .
Different frequencies of K-Ras , N-Ras , and H-Ras mutations in human tumors may also reflect differences in gene expression resulting from differential codon usage ; rare codons limit K-Ras expression and thus allow more efficient oncogenesis by preventing oncogene @-@ induced senescence ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0120" refid="bib35"> Lampson et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
In addition , different rates of DNA repair have been reported for the K-Ras gene relative to N-Ras and H-Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0125" refid="bib18"> Feng et al. , 2002 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
The underlying reasons for different frequencies of specific activating mutations are not well understood either .
Some of these differences reflect different mutagenic insults to the genome ; the G12C mutation , for example , is a hallmark of exposure to tobacco smoke and , accordingly , is the most common mutation in K-Ras in lung cancer ( reviewed in <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0130" refid="bib52"> Prior et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0135" refid="tbl2"> Table 2 </ce:cross-ref> <ce:float-anchor refid="tbl2" /> ) .
Other differences in frequency may reflect different biological properties of mutant proteins .
For example , G12C and G12V K-Ras mutations in lung adenocarcinoma preferentially activate the RalGDS pathway , whereas G12D prefers the Raf @/@ mitogen @-@ activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and PI3K pathways ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0140" refid="bib29"> Ihle et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
In addition , mutations at codon 61 have a more profound effect on intrinsic GTPase when these Ras proteins are bound to Raf kinase .
This may drive a stronger signal through this effector pathway and account for higher frequency of N-Ras position 61 mutations in melanoma , a disease frequently driven by hyperactivation of Raf kinase through B-Raf mutations ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0145" refid="bib8"> Buhrman et al. , 2010 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
From a clinical viewpoint , lung adenocarcinomas driven by K-Ras mutations at G12C and G12V have a worse outcome than G12D , possibly because these mutations engage different downstream effectors as described above ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0150" refid="fig1"> Figure 1 </ce:cross-ref> ; <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0155" refid="bib29"> Ihle et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
As MEK and PI3K inhibitors are tested in the clinic , it will be important to ask whether Ras alleles respond differently to these treatments .
Patients suffering from cancers driven by any of these Ras mutations are excluded from treatment with cetuximab ( colorectal cancer ) or erlotinib ( lung adenocarcinoma ) because these treatments are ineffective for cancers with these Ras mutations and may even increase rates of progression .
Likewise , malignant melanomas with mutant N-Ras are excluded from treatment with vemurafenib .
However , surprisingly , K-Ras @-@ G13D @-@ bearing colorectal cancers may show clinical benefit when treated with cetuximab .
This result challenges our understanding of how these Ras mutations actually function in clinical situations ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0160" refid="bib16"> De Roock et al. , 2010 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Even the prototypic oncogenes of Harvey and Kirsten sarcoma viruses are not fully understood ; each has a codon 12 mutation , but each also carries a mutation of alanine 59 to threonine , which becomes phosphorylated by guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) .
This must have helped Scolnick and colleagues ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0165" refid="bib62"> Shih et al. , 1979 </ce:cross-ref> ) identify Ras ’ crucial guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) / GTP properties ; without covalent phosphorylation , association with these nucleotides would have been very hard to detect .
However , how phosphorylation at threonine 59 contributes to Ras ’ potent oncogenicity is unclear .
This A59T mutation inhibits Ras @-@ Raf interaction ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0170" refid="bib63"> Shirouzu et al. , 1994 </ce:cross-ref> ) and is extremely rare in human cancer .
These anecdotes simply remind us that after 50 years , we still have a lot to learn about the biological and biochemical functions of Ras proteins .
Although K-Ras has emerged as by far the major Ras gene mutated in human cancer , it is surprising that other activating mutations in other members of the Ras superfamily , such as R-Ras or Rap proteins , occur very rarely .
This is surprising because these proteins share identical or near @-@ identical effector @-@ binding regions .
However , only H-Ras , N-Ras , and K-Ras are capable of binding and activating Raf kinases , and this unique property may well account for their predominance as human oncogenes .
In contrast , the closely related R-Ras proteins bind and activate PI3Ks but are rarely mutated in human cancer ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0175" refid="bib56"> Rodriguez @-@ Viciana et al. , 2004 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Activating mutations in Ras genes , coupled with a long history of Ras biology , implicate these mutant Ras proteins as major drivers in many cancers .
Loss of the Ras GTPase @-@ activating protein ( GAP ) neurofibromin inculpates hyperactive wild-type Ras proteins as drivers in many more cancers .
Somatic loss of neurofibromin expression by mutation , deletion , or by other means occurs in about 14 % glioblastoma , 13 % @–@ 14 % melanoma , 8 % @–@ 10 % lung adenocarcinoma , and at single @-@ digit frequency in most other cancers ( E.A. Collisson , personal communication ) .
Neurofibromin must now be considered as a major tumor suppressor , along with p53 and phosphatase and tensin homolog , in human cancers .
Loss of neurofibromin is usually mutually exclusive with Ras mutation and receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) activation , suggesting that these genetic events represent different ways of activating similar pathways .
However , the precise consequences of losing neurofibromin are not entirely clear .
Levels of Ras @-@ GTP are high in cells lacking neurofibromin , but which forms of hyperactive wild-type Ras proteins are most important to the malignant phenotype is a more difficult question .
Perhaps elevated H-Ras , N-Ras , K-Ras-4A , and K-Ras-4B all contribute to some extent .
However , neurofibromin is also a GAP for R-Ras proteins , and hyperactivation of these proteins can also contribute to the malignant phenotype because R-Ras proteins activate p110α , p110γ , and p110δ isoforms of PI3Ks ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0020" refid="bib42 bib28"> Marte et al. , 1997 ; Huang et al. , 2004 </ce:cross-refs> ) .
Recently , Legius and colleagues ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0180" refid="bib7"> Brems et al. , 2007 </ce:cross-ref> ) discovered mutations in the Sprouty @-@ related protein , SPRED1 , in a form of neurofibromatosis type I ( NF1 ) in which the neurofibromin gene is wild-type .
This disease is now called Legius syndrome ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0185" refid="bib7"> Brems et al. , 2007 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
SPRED1 has a well @-@ established pedigree as a negative regulator of the Raf @/@ MAPK pathway , though the mechanism has been unclear .
However , the fact that loss of neurofibromin is , to a significant extent , phenocopied by loss of SPRED1 , supports the idea that NF1 is a disease of hyperactive Ras and that the major function of neurofibromin is to turn Ras off .
The neurofibromin protein itself is over 2,800 amino acids in length , and the GAP domain only accounts for about 300 amino acids , raising the possibility that neurofibromin has other functions that are not directly related to negative regulation of Ras .
Most attempts to identify additional functions have failed , however , and it seems most likely that neurofibromin senses an unidentified cellular metabolite and downregulates Ras accordingly , just as p120 Ras @-@ GAP senses phosphotyrosine residues , and downregulates Ras when it binds to these residues on activated receptors in the plasma membrane ( reviewed in <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0190" refid="bib6"> Bos et al. , 2007 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Whatever neurofibromin senses ( if this model is correct ) is likely to be conserved between <i> S . cerevisiae </i> and humans because the <i> S . cerevisiae </i> IRA1 and IRA2 proteins look very much like neurofibromin .
Unfortunately , the complete lack of any recognizable domains or motifs outside the GAP domain and a SEC14 domain has not helped in identifying what these proteins recognize .
By comparing proteins that bind to wild-type SPRED1 versus mutants from Legius syndrome , we found that neurofibromin binds directly to SPRED proteins , via their EVH1 domains , and that SPRED proteins bring neurofibromin to the plasma membrane ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0195" refid="bib67"> Stowe et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
SPRED proteins also bind to c-Kit , and perhaps to other RTKs , suggesting that neurofibromin regulates Ras locally in response to specific receptor signaling , rather than simply suppressing Ras throughout the plasma membrane .
In this case , loss of neurofibromin may lead to local activation of Ras that is coupled to specific receptors , suggesting that inhibitors of these receptors might reverse the effects of neurofibromin loss .
The recent Cancer Genome Atlas analysis of mutations in lung cancer revealed an intriguing overlap between neurofibromin loss and Met amplification , suggesting a functional connection that merits further investigation ( E.A. Collisson , personal communication ) .
Validation of Ras as a Target
Ras oncogenes can certainly initiate cancer in model organisms and probably do so in humans .
However , their role in maintaining tumors is less clear .
There is significant evidence that supports K-Ras as a continued candidate for direct therapeutic targeting , dating back to the classic studies of temperature @-@ sensitive mutants of Ras , by Scolnick , Lowy , and colleagues and including microinjection studies with antibodies that block Ras activity ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0200" refid="bib34"> Kung et al. , 1986 </ce:cross-ref> ) or block specific mutant alleles of Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0205" refid="bib19"> Feramisco et al. , 1985 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Ablation of K-Ras in mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0210" refid="bib20"> Fisher et al. , 2001 </ce:cross-ref> ) or pancreas cancer ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0215" refid="bib83"> Ying et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ) led to dramatic tumor regression , just as ablation of H-Ras leads to tumor regression in mouse models of melanoma ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0220" refid="bib10"> Chin et al. , 1999 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
On the other hand , K-Ras knockdown in human cell lines resulted in a spectrum of responses , revealing a range of K-Ras dependencies ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0225" refid="bib64"> Singh et al. , 2009 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Assessment of Ras dependency in 3D culture systems suggests that this assay system is a more stringent measure of Ras dependency .
These studies raise the question of what is the most relevant system to measure this essential parameter and , in general , responses to candidate therapeutics targeting K-Ras .
Furthermore , the degree to which Ras genes are knocked down may be critical .
Genetic ablation is obviously different than small interfering RNA @- or small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - mediated knockdown .
It is also clear that knocking down activated Ras can lead to hyperactivation of upstream pathways , such as EGFR signaling ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0230" refid="bib84"> Young et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Presumably , these pathways are suppressed in cells with activated Ras and rebound when the suppressor is removed .
Although this rebound effect may not be sufficient to sustain a malignant phenotype , it may offset proapoptotic effects associated with oncogene inactivation .
Do K-Ras Therapies Have to Be Allele Specific ?
The most specific way to block oncogenic Ras would be to target the activating substitution itself .
The first example was recently published by Shokat and colleagues , who identified electrophilic compounds that react covalently with cysteine-12 in G12C mutant K-Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0235" refid="bib49"> Ostrem et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
These compounds interact selectively with the GDP form of K-Ras @-@ G12C protein ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0240" refid="fig2"> Figure 2 </ce:cross-ref> <ce:float-anchor refid="fig2" /> ) and bind at a pocket near switch 2 that had not been apparent from analysis of crystal structures .
A similar approach led to the identification of a GDP analog that covalently and specifically binds G12C and renders this oncogenic protein inactive ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0245" refid="bib38"> Lim et al. , 2014 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Perhaps other compounds could be identified that interact specifically with the G12D and G13D mutant forms using similar strategies .
These brilliant experiments remind us that these proteins are in dynamic and flexible states that might present more opportunities for small molecule attack than was previously realized .
Indeed , it is well established that Ras @-@ GTP exists in two states , only one of which is active and each with distinct binding properties for effectors , GAPs , and nucleotide ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0025" refid="bib21 bib36"> Geyer et al. , 1996 ; Liao et al. , 2008 </ce:cross-refs> ) .
The idea of targeting the GDP @-@ bound form of an oncogenic mutant seems counterintuitive because we often think of oncogenic mutants as being locked in their GTP @-@ bound states , signaling persistently downstream .
However , codon 12 mutants retain measurable intrinsic GTPase activity , even though they are all refractory to GAP @-@ mediated GTPase stimulation .
Although GTP hydrolysis rates are slow , the GDP off rates are also slow , and indeed , oncogenic mutants often exist with similar levels of GTP and GDP : if intrinsic GTPase and GDP off rates were identical , Ras proteins would be 50 % GTP bound and 50 % GDP bound .
This presents an opportunity for targeting the GDP @-@ bound state and trapping it in the off state and so preventing recharging with GTP .
As an alternative to targeting specific Ras mutants , such as G12C , compounds could be developed that target individual Ras isoforms but do not discriminate between wild-type and mutant Ras proteins .
This could be achieved by targeting specific hypervariable regions at the C terminus where the Ras proteins differ most widely ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0250" refid="fig3"> Figure 3 </ce:cross-ref> <ce:float-anchor refid="fig3" /> ) .
The C-terminal hypervariable region of K-Ras-4B is very different from the hypervariable regions of other Ras proteins and is involved in the specific interaction of K-Ras-4B with calmodulin ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0255" refid="bib40"> Lopez @-@ Alcalá et al. , 2008 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Because K-Ras-4B seems to be the major form of K-Ras in established tumors , these specific biochemical properties may afford unique opportunities for therapeutic attack .
Mouse models suggest that such compounds would be well tolerated because animals lacking any single isoform of Ras are viable ( A . Balmain , personal communication ) .
Targeting GDP @/@ GTP Binding and Exchange
Ras proteins bind GDP and GTP with picomolar affinity .
It is generally accepted that oncogenic Ras proteins can not be attacked with nucleotide analogs because high GTP concentrations make competition impossible .
The high affinity for GTP is also considered a barrier , though it is easy to imagine that analogs could be developed with equally high affinity .
This approach to targeting Ras has therefore been abandoned .
However , Ras proteins in their GTP state exist in complexes with effectors ( Raf kinases , RalGDS , PI3K , other Ras @-@ binding proteins ) , as well as regulators ( GAPs and guanine nucleotide exchange factors [ GEFs ] ) .
The effects of most of these proteins on nucleotide binding have not been measured .
GEFs , of course , greatly reduce the affinity for nucleotides , allowing GDP to be released rapidly and replaced by GTP .
Although oncogenic mutants do not need GEFs to put them in the active state , they are still sensitive to GEF @-@ mediated exchange and cycle through a complex state in which nucleotide @-@ free Ras protein is bound to the GEF ; this may provide a potential opportunity for a mutant @-@ specific nucleotide analog to bind .
In support of this , we noted many years ago that antibodies directed against specific codon 12 mutants were effective at reversing transformation in cells , as cited above , yet these antibodies do not bind to nucleotide @-@ loaded Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0260" refid="bib11"> Clark et al. , 1985 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
We therefore speculate that oncogenic Ras exists in a nucleotide @-@ free state frequently enough to make it vulnerable to attack .
Whether oncogenic Ras proteins are regulated at all by Sos and other GEFs has been surprisingly difficult to determine definitively , partly because there are many types of GEFs in mammalian cells .
Furthermore , GEFs such as Sos have allosteric sites for Ras binding as well as sites for GDP @/@ GTP exchange , and it is hard to measure GTP loading on individual Ras isoforms in cells .
However , it is clear that mutant Ras proteins are not 100 % GTP bound , and GEFs could increase the fraction of Ras @-@ GTP to some extent .
However , targeting Sos or other GEFs for treating mutant Ras cancers does not appear an attractive proposition .
Oncogenic mutants may or may not depend on GEFs , to some degree , but wild-type Ras proteins most certainly do .
For these reasons , recent efforts to target mutant Ras that led to compounds that bind at the Sos @-@ binding site may seem disappointing ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0030" refid="bib44 bib68"> Maurer et al. , 2012 ; Sun et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-refs> ) .
However , the compounds that these groups discovered could be excellent starting points toward the discovery of compounds that have selectivity for mutant forms of K-Ras or block effector interactions .
Restoring GTP Hydrolysis
Mutations at codons 12 , 13 , and 61 inhibit GAP @-@ mediated GTP hydrolysis .
As a result , mutant Ras proteins accumulate with elevated GTP @-@ bound proportion .
Trahey and McCormick discovered GAP while seeking to explain how relatively small changes in intrinsic GTPase between wild-type and mutant Ras proteins accounted for profound differences in transforming activity ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0265" refid="bib71"> Trahey and McCormick , 1987 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis are five orders of magnitude slower than rates catalyzed by GAPs and therefore do not contribute significantly to steady @-@ state levels of Ras @-@ GTP .
However , once Ras proteins bind effectors , GAPs can no longer interact , and intrinsic GTPase may become important in determining how long Ras and its effectors remain engaged .
Indeed , effector binding may well affect intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras as it does for heterotrimeric G proteins .
If indeed intrinsic GTPase limits signal output , perhaps assays for compounds that stimulate intrinsic GTPase of Ras effector complexes may merit consideration .
Mattos and colleagues recently showed that the Ras @-@ binding domain of Raf ( the RBD ) has a profound effect on suppressing intrinsic hydrolysis rates of Ras Q61 mutants , but not wild-type Ras or G12V mutants ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0270" refid="bib8"> Buhrman et al. , 2010 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
They propose that suppression of intrinsic GTPase stabilizes Ras @-@ Raf complexes and increases signal output to the MAPK pathway selectively ; this accounts for the preference of Q61 mutants over G12 mutants in melanoma , a disease that is clearly Raf @-@ MAPK driven ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0275" refid="bib8"> Buhrman et al. , 2010 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
In the 1980 s , several groups , including those at Cetus and Hoffmann La Roche , screened for compounds that restore GTP hydrolysis to mutant Ras , in the presence or absence of GAP .
These screens failed to find compounds that increased GTPase rates .
Furthermore , as structures of Ras proteins emerged , mostly from Wittinghofer ’s group , it became clear that codon 12 substitutions presented a steric block to GAP @-@ mediated GTP hydrolysis that could not be overcome by a small molecule .
These studies were mostly based on G12V mutations because these were the most widely used at that time .
Whether the same conclusion can be applied to other mutations such as G12D or G13D remains to be seen because structures of these proteins bound to GAP have not been solved .
The approach of restoring GTP hydrolysis to mutant proteins received a brief infusion of hope when Scheffzek and colleagues showed that G12V H-Ras could indeed hydrolyze a GTP analog diaminobenzophenone @-@ phosphoroamidate @-@ GTP in which the aromatic amino group mimics the catalytic effects of GAP ’s arginine finger ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0280" refid="bib2"> Ahmadian et al. , 1999 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
A small molecule that provided this local charge might therefore trick mutant Ras into GTP hydrolysis .
At first sight , the GTD- @/@ GTP @-@ binding site of Ras does not offer any room for such a molecule to bind .
However , these issues deserve rethinking @—@ perhaps G12D offers more possibilities for this kind of attack than G12V , for example .
Targeting Ras Posttranslational Modification Pathways
Ras proteins are processed in several steps ( reviewed in <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0285" refid="bib24"> Gysin et al. , 2011 </ce:cross-ref> ) , including farnesylation , proteolytic cleavage at the C terminus by RCE1 , and carboxymethylation by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase ( ICMT ) .
K-Ras-4A , H-Ras , and N-Ras are further processed by palmitoylation ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0290" refid="fig3"> Figure 3 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
These reactions are not only essential for plasma membrane localization but also for Raf kinase activation .
The failure of farnesyltransferase inhibitors has been well documented .
By sheer bad luck , the forms of Ras that play the major roles in human cancer , K-Ras and N-Ras , can be geranylgeranylated when farnesyltransferase is inhibited , allowing newly synthesized Ras proteins to be inserted correctly in the membrane and to function normally .
H-Ras , on the other hand , is not geranylgeranylated , suggesting that tumors driven by mutant H-Ras , such as bladder cancer or thyroid cancer , might be susceptible to farnesyltransferase inhibition .
Targeting RCE1 or ICMT has also been evaluated , though the consequences of blocking these enzymes are difficult to predict or understand .
For example , inhibition of either enzyme can actually lead to increased Ras @-@ mediated tumorigenesis ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0035" refid="bib13 bib76"> Court et al. , 2013 ; Wahlstrom et al. , 2007 </ce:cross-refs> ) .
Palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of H-Ras , K-Ras-4A , and N-Ras proteins provide dynamic aspects to membrane localization and may present therapeutic opportunities for these proteins .
Recent work demonstrated that acyl protein thioesterase 1 ( APT1 ) , which is responsible for Ras depalmitoylation , could be targeted by palmostatin B to selectively inhibit the growth of N-Ras mutant leukemia cells ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0295" refid="bib80"> Xu et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
In contrast , K-Ras-4B localization seemed relatively static and stable : specific localization of K-Ras-4B to plasma membranes is based on electrostatic interactions between lysine residues in the hypervariable region and phospholipids in the membrane .
However , another therapeutic opportunity has been presented by the discovery that PDE6δ acts as a solubilizing factor that modulates Ras proteins by sustaining their dynamic distribution in cellular membranes .
A small molecule was identified that prevents association of K-Ras-4B , and other proteins , with PDEδ and so delocalizes these proteins and inhibits downstream signaling ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0300" refid="bib86"> Zimmermann et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Little is still known about the trafficking of Ras to and from the membrane , and there are likely to be additional factors or chaperones involved in the movement of the proteins that could serve as targets for small molecules .
In a related study , K-Ras-4B was shown to undergo retrograde trafficking from the plasma membrane to endomembranes .
This may serve as an additional pathway to specifically disrupt for therapeutic benefit ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0305" refid="bib4"> Bivona et al. , 2006 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
In addition to these processing events , several recent papers have highlighted other posttranslational modifications of K-Ras that could serve as therapeutic targets .
Mono @-@ ubiquitination at Lys147 has been shown to enhance GTP loading and effector @-@ binding affinity of K-Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0310" refid="bib59"> Sasaki et al. , 2011 </ce:cross-ref> ) , suggesting that targeting of ubiquitin pathway enzymes might have an effect on K-Ras activity .
Acetylation of Lys104 was shown to decrease GEF @-@ induced nucleotide exchange , leading to reduced transformation efficiency in cells , and the deacetylases SIRT2 and HDAC6 were shown to regulate the level of acetylation of K-Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0315" refid="bib81"> Yang et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) , suggesting that inhibitors of these enzymes might have an effect on the oncogenic potential of mutant K-Ras tumors .
Finally , nitrosylation of Cys118 in H-Ras has been shown to activate Ras by enhancing nucleotide dissociation , leading to higher levels of GTP @-@ bound protein .
The eNos protein was identified as a strong enhancer of nitrosylation and therefore could also be a therapeutic target to attack mutant Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0320" refid="bib37"> Lim et al. , 2008 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Downstream Pathways and Drug Targets
When it became clear that targeting mutant Ras proteins directly was technically impossible with the tools available at that time , the search for drugs that block Ras activity moved downstream .
In the early 1990 s , the MAPK pathway and the PI3K pathway were known to be downstream of Ras ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0325" refid="fig1"> Figure 1 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
In 1993 , four groups showed that Ras binds directly to Raf kinase ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0040" refid="bib47 bib73 bib77 bib85"> Moodie et al. , 1993 ; Van Aelst et al. , 1993 ; Warne et al. , 1993 ; Zhang et al. , 1993 </ce:cross-refs> ) , and later , activation of Raf kinase by Ras was achieved in vitro ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0330" refid="bib66"> Stokoe and McCormick , 1997 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
This was unexpectedly difficult ; for one thing , Raf activation by Ras required fully processed Ras in a lipid environment , and direct binding of unprocessed Ras failed to activate the kinase .
Furthermore , autophosphorylation rapidly shut down Raf kinase in vitro ; we had to preincubate processed Ras with Raf in the absence of ATP before measuring Raf kinase activity .
This autophosphorylation accounts , at least in part , for paradoxical activation of Raf kinase by Raf inhibitors , a phenomenon that was discovered 16 years later ( reviewed in <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0335" refid="bib27"> Holderfield et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
These issues complicate the development of in vitro assays for compounds that prevent Ras @-@ dependent activation of Raf kinase , an obvious system for therapeutic intervention .
Direct blocking of Ras @-@ Raf binding with small molecules does not appear to be a promising approach because the binding surface ( two antiparallel β strands ) offers no foothold in which a compound could bind .
However , for example , preventing binding using peptides or by indirect allosteric approaches has been considered ( see <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0340" refid="bib79"> Wu et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
The drug discovery group at Onyx Pharmaceuticals began screening for Raf kinase inhibitors in 1992 after it was able produce active c-Raf kinase in baculovirus ( by coinfection with v-Src ) and to reconstitute the MAPK pathway in vitro ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0345" refid="bib41"> Macdonald et al. , 1993 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
It was then assumed that in cancer cells with mutant Ras , the Raf @/@ MAPK pathway would be hyperactive and that drugs that inhibit Raf would be effective ways of treating Ras mutant cancers .
It was also assumed that MEK and extracellular signal @-@ regulated kinase ( ERK ) inhibitors would have the same effect .
In hindsight , most of the assumptions were incorrect : the Raf @/@ MAPK pathway is not often hyperactive in human cancer cells with mutant Ras , as measured by steady @-@ state levels of phospho @-@ MEK or phospho @-@ ERK .
Raf inhibitors lead to paradoxical activation of Raf kinase following exposure to Raf inhibitors , especially in Ras mutant cancers ( reviewed in <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0350" refid="bib39"> Lito et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
MEK and ERK inhibitors do not show paradoxical activation but are generally ineffective on their own because they relieve feedback inhibition on upstream kinases , leading to activation of PI3K , among other effects ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0045" refid="bib45 bib12 bib72 bib46"> Mirzoeva et al. , 2009 ; Corcoran et al. , 2012 ; Turke et al. , 2012 ; Montero @-@ Conde et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-refs> ) , and because they lack a clear therapeutic window .
MEK1 @/@ MEK2 isoforms have a high degree of amino acid identity , suggesting redundant roles in signaling .
The same is true for ERK1 @/@ ERK2 .
However , knocking out the gene encoding MEK1 , <i> Map2k1 </i> ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0355" refid="bib22"> Giroux et al. , 1999 </ce:cross-ref> ) , or the gene encoding ERK2 , <i> Mapk1 </i> ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0050" refid="bib26 bib57 bib82"> Hatano et al. , 2003 ; Saba @-@ El @-@ Leil et al. , 2003 ; Yao et al. , 2003 </ce:cross-refs> ) , is embryonic lethal , indicating a requirement for signaling from a particular isoform , at least in the context of embryogenesis .
Although <i> Map2k2 </i> <sup loc="post"> <i> −/− </i> </sup> ( MEK2 null ) and <i> Mapk3 </i> <sup loc="post"> <i> −/− </i> </sup> ( ERK1 null ) mice are viable , in vivo ablation of MEK1 in a <i> Map2k2 </i> <sup loc="post"> <i> −/− </i> </sup> background ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0055" refid="bib60 bib5"> Scholl et al. , 2007 ; Blasco et al. , 2011 </ce:cross-refs> ) or ERK2 in a <i> Mapk3 </i> <sup loc="post"> <i> −/− </i> </sup> background ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0360" refid="bib9"> Chan et al. , 2013 </ce:cross-ref> ) results in apoptosis and lethality in adult mice .
This may suggest a limited therapeutic window for any pan inhibitor of these kinases , and the clinical toxicity of potential drugs in this target class bears this out .
The Onyx @/@ Bayer screen for c-Raf inhibitors led to the discovery and development of sorafenib .
However , it was disappointing when sorafenib failed to show clinical benefit in early clinical trials against Ras mutant cancers , and this lack of response was difficult to understand because sorafenib does indeed inhibit Raf kinase .
Despite this , sorafenib and fluoro-sorafenib ( regorafenib ) have since been approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma , hepatocellular carcinoma , thyroid cancer , colorectal cancer , and gastrointestinal stromal cancer .
In hepatocellular carcinoma , biomarker analysis in Phase II clinical trials showed a clear correlation between levels of phospho @-@ ERK and clinical response , suggesting that inhibition of Raf kinase is responsible for part of the clinical benefit ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0365" refid="bib1"> Abou-Alfa et al. , 2006 </ce:cross-ref> ) , but in the other indications , it appears likely that inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 or other kinases is responsible .
Hopefully , a clearer picture will emerge through analysis of exceptional responders or through deciphering mechanisms of drug resistance .
Inhibitors of PI3K pathway have not yet fared much better in the clinic , also because of feedback mechanisms that activate upstream signaling , as well as poor therapeutic index .
However , the relative failure of these downstream approaches does not mean that they are not critical to Ras oncogenesis .
Indeed , ablation of c-Raf ( but not B-Raf ) in mice inhibits development and delays progression of Ras @-@ driven tumors in a lung adenocarcinoma model ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0370" refid="bib5"> Blasco et al. , 2011 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
However , in an in vivo pancreatic cancer mouse model , B-Raf was shown to be required for tumor progression ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0375" refid="bib65"> Sobczak et al. , 2008 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
This suggests tissue @-@ specific signaling cascades and will require more investigation .
Genetic disruption of Ras binding to PI3K-α has a similar effect .
We can therefore assume that small molecules that can block downstream signaling without triggering feedback and with the correct specificity and biochemical properties may still be effective , but more work needs to be done to develop such compounds effectively .
The third direct effector arm of Ras signaling that plays a major role in human cancer is the RalGDS ( Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator ) pathway ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0380" refid="fig1"> Figure 1 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Perhaps the best evidence of the importance of this effector pathway comes from demonstration that mice null for RalGDS have reduced skin carcinogen @-@ induced tumor incidence , size , and progression to malignancy compared to wild-type mice ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0385" refid="bib23"> González @-@ García et al. , 2005 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
These data , and many others ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0060" refid="bib43 bib32"> Martin et al. , 2011 ; Kashatus , 2013 </ce:cross-refs> ) , support a role for RalGDS both in vitro and in vivo as an important effector pathway utilized by oncogenic Ras to drive tumorigenesis that could potentially be exploited for therapeutic intervention , although the absence of somatic mutations in this effector pathway makes its precise role less clear than the Raf @/@ MAPK and PI3K pathways .
On the other hand , Ral signaling is upstream of NF-κB and TBK1 , both of which have been implicated as essential genes downstream of K-Ras ( <ce:cross-refs id="crosrefs0065" refid="bib48 bib32"> Neel et al. , 2011 ; Kashatus , 2013 </ce:cross-refs> ) .
Other potential Ras effectors that could be important in cancer and therefore a source of potential therapeutic targets include phospholipase CE and Tiam1 , a GEF that stimulates the activation of Rac ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0390" refid="fig1"> Figure 1 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Rac1 is necessary for K-Ras tumor initiation , further implicating the importance of this pathway in K-Ras tumorigenesis , though not yet providing obvious therapeutic targets ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0395" refid="bib24"> Gysin et al. , 2011 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Likewise , cyclin D1 , NF-κB , and Myc are necessary for Ras tumorigenesis ; further analysis of the role of these pathways may lead to new therapeutic insights .
For example , <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0400" refid="bib53"> Puyol et al. ( 2010 ) </ce:cross-ref> recently demonstrated that germline or conditional deletion of <i> Cdk4 </i> led to senescence in lung cells expressing activated K-Ras .
Furthermore , treatment with a Cdk4 inhibitor reduced the growth of K-Ras @-@ driven tumors .
Finally , unbiased shRNA screens have revealed potential targets for K-Ras cancers .
These include STK33 , TBK1 , and GATA-2 .
So far , STK33 inhibition does not appear to be a useful approach to K-Ras cancers ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0405" refid="bib78"> Weiwer et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
TBK1 inhibitors are still being investigated : this target is of particular interest because it is part of the well @-@ validated RalGDS pathway .
GATA2 is also of considerable interest ; genetic ablation leads to tumor regression in mouse models of adenocarcinoma of the lung , and whereas this transcription factor may appear to be the least druggable of targets , its role in regulating the proteasome suggested therapeutic approaches that appear very promising ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0410" refid="bib33"> Kumar et al. , 2012 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
Future Prospects
In this Review , we have summarized some of the challenges of targeting Ras cancers .
Despite the tremendous progress that has been made , we still have to learn a great deal about these cancers before we can be confident that we can treat them effectively .
Recent experience in targeting Raf and MEK has underscored how a pathway that appeared simple and linear is extremely complex and poorly understood at the level of detail required to shut it down effectively .
Nobody expected that Raf inhibitors would activate Raf kinase in Ras @-@ transformed cells , for example , or that inhibition of downstream kinases like MEK would lead to activation of upstream signaling .
We need a much deeper analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying Ras regulation and effector engagement before we can expect to interfere with these mechanisms effectively .
It seems to us more likely that these deeper insights will lead to productive approaches for intervention than to the conclusion that Ras is indeed undruggable .
New technologies and insights and fresh eyes are likely to solve this problem .
We are also optimistic that completely different approaches to treating cancer will contribute to eliminating Ras cancers , including new ways of knocking down @/@ out genes using RNAi and CRISPR technologies and delivering these payloads to tumors ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0415" refid="bib14"> Davis et al. , 2010 </ce:cross-ref> ) , as well as new ways of deploying the immune system .
In this respect , it is noteworthy that anti @-@ CTLA-4 therapy appears to be equally effective in treating melanoma driven by N-Ras or B-Raf ; therefore , Ras cancers may not be excluded from these approaches as they have been from others .
All of these considerations lead us to be optimistic about future prospects of finally delivering the knockout punch .

Ras proteins are converted from their GDP state to their GTP state by GEFs , in response to upstream signals ( <ce:cross-ref id="crosref0425" refid="bib6"> Bos et al. , 2007 </ce:cross-ref> ) .
GAPs convert Ras @-@ GTP back to Ras @-@ GDP .

Met receptor @-@ induced Grb2 or Shc signals both promote transformation of intestinal epithelial cells , albeit they are required for distinct oncogenic functions ( PMID : 24708867 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
We show , for the first time , that constitutive activation of either Grb2 or Shc signals in IEC-6 cells , promotes morphological transformation associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin , as well as increased cell growth , loss of growth contact inhibition , anchorage @-@ independent growth , and resistance to serum deprivation and anoikis .
Oncogenic activation of Met was revealed to induce morphological transformation , E-cadherin down-regulation , and protection against anoikis by mechanisms dependent on Grb2 , while Shc was shown to be partly required for enhanced cell growth .
The coupling of activated Met to the Ras @/@ MEK @/@ Erk and PI3K @/@ Akt pathways , and the sustained engagement of Grb2 or Shc in IECs , was shown to trigger negative feedback , limiting the extent of activation of these pathways .
Nonetheless , morphological alterations and E-cadherin down-regulation induced by the oncogenic Tpr @-@ Met , and by Grb2 or Shc signals , were blocked by MEK , but not PI3K , inhibitors while the enhanced growth and resistance to anoikis induced by Tpr @-@ Met were nearly abolished by co-treatment with both inhibitors .

<sec-title level="2"> Oncogenic engagement of Grb2 or Shc signaling promotes morphological transformation in normal IECs and reduces E-cadherin expression </sec-title>
In contrast with many other RTKs , the ability of the Met receptor to recruit signaling proteins , and thus its biological activities , is dependent on two phospho @-@ Tyr residues located within its C-terminus ( Y1349 @/@ Y1356 in Met ; Y482 @/@ Y489 in Tpr @-@ Met [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref>@ ] ) .
This unique characteristic has been exploited to generate Met receptor variants capable of binding exclusively to a single RTK @-@ proximal signaling protein [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref>@ ] .
These well @-@ characterized docking @-@ specific Met variants consist of the cytosolic oncogenic form of the Met receptor , Tpr @-@ Met , in which the multi @-@ substrate binding region has been replaced with a motif selective for the recruitment of a single signaling protein , found in other RTKs ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> and [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref>@ ] ) .
To determine whether the selective oncogenic engagement of either the Grb2 or the Shc adaptor protein was sufficient to induce transformation of IECs , we generated populations of IEC-6 cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] expressing Tpr @-@ Met variants that specifically bind to either the Grb2 ( TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 cells ) or Shc ( TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 and TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells , respectively ) adaptor proteins , through retroviral infection .
For each experiment , these cells were compared with the previously characterized untransformed sham @-@ infected IEC-6 ( Control @-@ IEC-6 ) cells or those transformed by unmodified Tpr @-@ Met ( Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 ) [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref>@ ] .
TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 , and TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells were morphologically transformed to a similar extent relative to Control @-@ IEC-6 cells , which grew in colonies and displayed typical normal epithelioid morphology ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .
Morphological changes induced in the TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 , and TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells include an apparent breakdown of cell @-@ cell contacts , cell dispersal , the acquisition of a fibroblast @-@ like spindle @-@ shaped morphology , and a more refractile appearance than the Control @-@ IEC-6 cells .
Cells expressing the Grb2 and Shc docking @-@ specific oncoproteins also displayed many cell membrane protrusions typical of lamellipodia and invadopodia @-@ like structures .
The Tpr @-@ Met variants exhibited comparable levels of Tyr phosphorylation in IEC-6 cells , relative to their expression levels ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .
They also demonstrated the predicted binding selectivity [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"> 9 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref>@ ] ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> 1 </xref> ) .
Since such morphological changes in epithelial cells are typically associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin , immunoblot ( IB ) analysis of the E-cadherin protein levels were performed [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"> 31 </xref>@ ] .
Consistent with the previous characterization of Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref>@ ] , also presented herein , oncogenic activation of Grb2 @- and especially Shc @-@ specific signals led to a dramatic decrease in E-cadherin protein levels relative to the Control @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ B ) .
Likewise , a marked reduction in E-cadherin ( <i> Cdh1 </i> ) mRNA levels was observed in these cells , as determined by semi @-@ quantitative and quantitative real-time RT @–@ PCR analyses ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ C and D ) .
Analysis of the expression profiles of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors in these IECs suggests that a combined up-regulation of <i> Snail2 </i> , <i> Twist1 , </i> or <i> Twist2 </i> , but not of <i> Snail1 </i> or <i> Zeb1 </i> , may partly account for the E-cadherin repression induced by oncogenic Met @-@ dependent signaling , including that one driven by Grb2 and Shc signals ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref> ) .
Overall , these results demonstrate that oncogenic activation of Grb2 @- and Shc @-@ dependent signaling pathways , such as those activated by Tpr @-@ Met , is sufficient to induce an epithelial @-@ mesenchymal morphological @-@ like transformation in normal IECs .
<sec-title level="2"> Oncogenic engagement of Grb2 or Shc signaling enhances cell growth and loss of contact inhibition in IECs </sec-title>
We next tested the oncogenic growth characteristics of IEC-6 cells transformed by the Tpr @-@ Met variants .
First , cell @-@ counting assays were performed to determine the growth rate of each cell population .
The TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 , and TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells displayed more rapid growth than Control @-@ IEC-6 cells , albeit to a lesser extent than Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Notably , TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 cells exhibited accelerated growth relative to TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 and TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells , between which the doubling time did not differ significantly .
The enhanced growth promoting activity of the TM-Shc1 relative to the TM-Shc2 correlates with the affinity of their respective Shc binding sites [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref>@ ] .
Typical of untransformed cells , IEC-6 cells ceased proliferation upon the establishment of cell @-@ cell contacts [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref>@ ] .
As such , Control @-@ IEC-6 cells formed a monolayer of well @-@ organized epithelial cells upon reaching confluence ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ B ) .
In sharp contrast , each of the oncogenic transformed IEC-6 cell populations appeared highly disorganized and grew in multiple layers at confluence ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ B ) .
Thus , oncogenic specific activation of Grb2 @- or Shc @-@ dependent signals permits IECs to bypass contact inhibition of growth .
To validate this in a quantitative manner , focus formation assays were performed .
As expected [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref>@ ] , Control @-@ IEC-6 cells failed to form foci , whereas TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 , and TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells displayed strong focus @-@ forming capacities , though less than that of Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ C and D ) .
The number and size of foci formed by the TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 cells were markedly greater than those of the TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 or TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ C and D ) , likely reflecting their accelerated growth rate ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
These results indicate that the oncogenic engagement of Grb2 @- and Shc @-@ dependent signals is sufficient to relieve contact inhibition of growth in IECs .
<sec-title level="2"> Oncogenic engagement of Grb2 and Shc signaling induces anchorage @-@ independent growth and anoikis resistance in IECs </sec-title>
We next verified whether the oncogenic activation of Grb2 @- or Shc @-@ dependent signals is sufficient to confer to non @-@ transformed IEC-6 cells the capacity to grow in the absence of anchorage to the extra @-@ cellular matrix ( ECM ) , by performing soft agar growth assays .
Consistent with previous findings [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref>@ ] , Control @-@ IEC-6 cells failed to grow in soft agar whereas Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells grew efficiently , forming numerous large colonies ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A–C ) .
TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 , and TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells also formed colonies in soft agar , but with lower efficiencies .
While the three IEC-6 cell populations expressing docking @-@ specific Tpr @-@ Met variants formed similar numbers of colonies ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A ) , those produced by the TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 cells were larger and displayed a different morphology from those produced by the TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 and TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B and C ) .
Colonies formed by the TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 cells were composed mainly of loosely associated cells with apparently limited cell @-@ cell contacts , similar to Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 colonies ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
By contrast , colonies produced by the TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 or TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells were compact and composed of tightly associated cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
Growth in soft agar reflects not only the capacity of cells to proliferate in the absence of ECM attachment , but also to avoid anoikis , a form of apoptosis induced upon loss of matrix attachment [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"> 32 </xref>@ ] .
Anoikis assays were performed by monitoring the viability of cells seeded in the absence of serum under adherent and suspension conditions .
As expected for normal IECs [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"> 33 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref>@ ] , Control @-@ IEC-6 cells displayed anoikis sensitivity under suspension culture conditions ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ D ) .
In contrast , IEC-6 cells transformed by either Tpr @-@ Met , or the Grb2 or Shc docking @-@ specific oncoproteins , displayed potent resistance to anoikis , with more than half surviving under non @-@ adherent conditions .
Likewise , the viability of these transformed cells was significantly higher than that of Control @-@ IEC-6 cells when seeded in the absence of serum and under adherent conditions ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ E ) .
Overall , these results indicate that the oncogenic engagement of signals downstream of Grb2 or Shc is sufficient to alleviate the anchorage @-@ dependence of growth , and to reduce sensitivity to growth factor deprivation and to anoikis in IECs .
<sec-title level="2"> Silencing of Grb2 impairs Tpr @-@ Met @-@ induced morphological transformation and anoikis resistance in IECs , but reduced expression of Shc decreases cell growth </sec-title>
The above results with the docking @-@ specific Tpr @-@ Met @-@ derived variants established that the oncogenic activation of either Grb2 or Shc signaling pathways was each sufficient to promote transformation of IECs , conferring upon them aberrant growth characteristics and resistance to anoikis .
We next sought to determine whether signaling pathways downstream of these adaptor proteins were required for the oncogenic potential of Met in IECs .
The impact of silencing the expression of Grb2 or Shc on the features of the Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells was evaluated .
Stable populations of Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells displaying marked and selective knockdown of Grb2 ( TM-shGrb2 ) or Shc ( TM-shShc ) were generated using shRNAs .
As demonstrated by IB analyses ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ A ) , Grb2 and Shc ( all ShcA isoforms ) protein levels were selectively reduced by more than 60 % in TM-shGrb2 and TM-shShc cell populations , respectively , compared to Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells expressing a non @-@ targeting shRNA ( TM-shCTRL ) .
Protein levels of Tpr @-@ Met and actin remained equivalent amongst all these cell populations .
Phase contrast microscopy revealed that the TM-shGrb2 cells exhibited a partial reversal of the transformed morphology , relative to TM-shCTRL cells , characterized by a decrease in cell refractility and an increase in cell spreading ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ B ) .
In contrast , the TM-shShc cells maintained the transformed morphology , and even adopted a slightly more elongated and spindle @-@ shaped appearance than the control TM-shCTRL cells .
Concordant with these morphological changes , E-cadherin protein levels were enhanced in TM-shGrb2 cells and reduced in TM-shShc cells , when compared to TM-shCTRL cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ C and D ) .
Growth and survival characteristics of these cells were then evaluated in cell @-@ count and anoikis assays , respectively .
While the TM-shGrb2 cells displayed similar growth capacity to TM-shCTRL cells , growth of the TM-shShc cells was observed to decrease in a time @-@ dependent manner , reaching significant inhibition ( 37.67 ± 5.32 % ) 3 days after seeding ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ E ) .
The TM-shGrb2 cells displayed enhanced anoikis sensitivity when compared to the TM-shCTRL and TM-shShc cells , between which no difference in survival in suspension was observed ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ F ) .
As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ G , no significant difference in cell viability was observed between the TM-shGrb2 , TM-shShc , and TM-shCTRL cells 18 hours following seeding in the absence of serum under adherent conditions ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4 </xref>@ G ) .
Together , these results suggest that signals downstream of Grb2 and Shc proteins are required for non @-@ overlapping functions promoted by the oncogenic Met receptor in IECs .
<sec-title level="2"> MEK , but not PI3K inhibitors reduce IEC transformation promoted by the oncogenic engagement of Met , Grb2 , or Shc signals </sec-title>
The Grb2 and Shc adaptor proteins are known to couple RTKs , such as the Met receptor , to the Ras @/@ MAPK and PI3K @/@ Akt signaling pathways [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref>@ - @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref>@ ] .
The Ras @/@ MAPK and PI3K @/@ Akt pathways are important regulators of RTK @-@ mediated epithelial cell transformation , but their actions are cell type @-@ specific [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"> 31 </xref>@ ] .
To define the role of these signaling pathways in IEC transformation , we first compared their activation status in IEC-6 cells transformed by the Tpr @-@ Met , TM-Grb2 , TM-Shc1 , and TM-Shc2 oncoproteins , to that one in non @-@ transformed Control @-@ IEC-6 cells .
The phosphorylation @/@ activation levels of the downstream effectors of MEK and PI3K , Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt , respectively , were assessed by IB analyses of lysates prepared from serum @-@ starved IEC-6 cells .
Phosphorylation levels of neither Erk1 @/@ Erk2 nor Akt were elevated in Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 , or TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells , relative to Control @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ A ) .
Both Erk2 and Akt protein levels were comparable in all IEC-6 cell populations .
A similar trend of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt phosphorylation was observed in cells maintained in the presence of serum ( data not shown ) .
The lack of evidence for Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt activation in IEC-6 cells stably expressing the constitutively activated form of the Met receptor , or the Grb2 and Shc docking @-@ specific oncoproteins , is consistent with both the Ras @/@ MAPK and PI3K @/@ Akt pathways being subject to negative feedback mechanisms [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35"> 35 </xref>@ ] .
It can not be explained as merely a cell type @–@ specific event , since similarly stable expression of these oncoproteins in fibroblasts failed to promote Erk1 @/@ Erk2 or Akt activation [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36"> 36 </xref>@ ] and unpublished observation ] .
We next investigated whether , even at the low levels observed , MEK or PI3K activities were implicated in the induction of transformation features in IEC-6 cells by the Tpr @-@ Met , TM-Grb2 , TM-Shc1 , or TM-Shc2 oncoproteins .
Cells were treated with vehicle ( DMSO ) , 10 μM U0126 ( a MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor ) , 10 μM LY294002 ( a PI3K inhibitor ) , or a combination of both inhibitors , and their morphology was examined by phase contrast microscopy , following 24 ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> ) and 48 hours of treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ B ) .
Neither individual inhibitor treatment , nor the combination , had an obvious effect on the morphology of the Control @-@ IEC-6 cells .
Interestingly , the MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor , but not the PI3K inhibitor , induced a potent reversion of the transformed morphological features of the Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Grb2 @-@ IEC-6 , TM-Shc1 @-@ IEC-6 , and TM-Shc2 @-@ IEC-6 cells , observed within 24 hours of treatment ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> ) and more striking in appearance after 48 hours ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ B ) .
In the presence of U0126 , the MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor , either alone or in combination with the PI3K inhibitor , the formerly transformed Tpr @-@ IEC-6 cells progressively lost their fibroblast @-@ like spindle @-@ shaped morphology , adopted a flatter cobblestone @-@ like appearance , reformed apparent cell @-@ cell contacts and grew again in colonies ; much like the non @-@ transformed Control @-@ IEC-6 cells .
Concordant with this restoration of epithelioid @-@ like morphological features in IEC-6 cells transformed by the oncogenic Tpr @-@ Met and its derived variants , treatment with U0126 also induced an increase in E-cadherin protein levels ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ C and D , and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> ) .
By contrast , none of the inhibitor treatments affected E-cadherin protein levels in the Control @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ C and D ) .
Notably , reversion of the transformed phenotype and E-cadherin up-regulation were also promoted in transformed IEC-6 cell populations by treatment with 10 μM AZD6244 or PD184352 , two additional pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ B and C , and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> ) .
Furthermore , these observations could not be attributed to the cytosolic localization of the Tpr @-@ Met oncoprotein , since both the morphological transformation and the E-cadherin down-regulation induced by a cell surface @-@ localized active chimeric colony stimulating factor 1 ( CSF ) - Met receptor [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref>@ ] , were reverted in a similar manner upon the inhibition of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 activity , but not of PI3K activity ( Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3"> 3 </xref> ) .
Since Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt activities remained at basal levels in transformed IEC-6 cell populations , the efficacy of these pharmacological inhibitors was evaluated by testing their ability to suppress serum @-@ induced Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt phosphorylation .
Serum @-@ starved Tpr @-@ Met and control IEC-6 cell populations were treated for 1 hour with DMSO or inhibitors , followed by 5 minutes of stimulation with 10 % serum .
A robust phosphorylation of Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt proteins was seen upon serum stimulation of Control @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ E ) .
In sharp contrast , although the levels of Erk2 and Akt proteins were equivalent for each cell population , serum @-@ induced Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt activation were severely attenuated in the Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ E ) .
This further substantiates the conclusion that sustained activation of Met signaling pathways , such as those downstream of Grb2 and Shc , can activate negative feedback control of both the Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt pathways in IECs .
Importantly , the MEK1 @/@ MEK2 and PI3K inhibitors were confirmed to efficiently suppress serum @-@ induced Erk1 @/@ Erk2 and Akt phosphorylation , respectively ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref>@ E ) .
Although the potential off @-@ target effects of these inhibitors can not be excluded in these experiments , our results suggest that the morphological transformation induced by the oncogenic Met receptor , and driven by the constitutive activation of Grb2 and Shc signals in IECs , relies , at least in part , on the activation of the Ras @/@ MAPK pathway , but not on PI3K signaling .
<sec-title level="2"> The growth promoting effect of oncogenic Met in IECs is blocked by MEK inhibition , but anoikis sensitivity is restored by concomitant treatment with MEK and PI3K inhibitors </sec-title>
We next investigated whether the growth capacity promoted by the oncogenic Met in IECs required MEK or PI3K activity .
Cell @-@ count assays were performed with Tpr @-@ Met and Control @-@ IEC-6 cells that were treated for 24 or 48 hours with vehicle , U0126 or LY294002 inhibitor , or a combination of both inhibitors .
As anticipated , treatment with DMSO did not significantly impact cell growth , even after 48 hours .
Treatment with LY294002 exerted similar inhibitory effects upon the growth of both the Tpr @-@ Met @-@ transformed and control IEC-6 cells , reducing the number of cells by 44 % and 36 % , respectively relative to DMSO @-@ treated cells , after 48 hours ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ A ) .
In contrast , in the presence of U0126 , the growth of Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells was significantly attenuated but not that of Control @-@ IEC-6 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ A ) .
Furthermore , while co-treatment with U0126 failed to potentiate the growth inhibiting effect of LY294002 in Control @-@ IEC-6 cells , the growth of Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells was further reduced in a time @-@ dependent manner upon exposure to both inhibitors ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ A ) .
The impact of inhibiting MEK1 @/@ MEK2 or PI3K activity on the viability of Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells in suspension was also evaluated .
In these anoikis assays , vehicle or the indicated inhibitors were added when cells were seeded and cell viability was measured 24 and 48 hours later .
Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor restored anoikis sensitivity to the Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells in a time @-@ dependent manner , reducing their viability by close to 45 % relative to DMSO @-@ treated cells after 48 hours ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ B ) .
The MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibitor , on the other hand , did not substantially impact the viability of the Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cells grown in suspension .
Nonetheless , U0126 treatment did elicit a marked synergistic effect on LY294002 @-@ induced anoikis , reducing Tpr @-@ Met @-@ IEC-6 cell viability to levels well below those seen upon treatment with the PI3K inhibitor alone ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ B ) .
These results suggest that Tpr @-@ Met @-@ mediated growth promoting effects observed in IECs implicate MEK @-@ dependent mechanisms , but that the anoikis resistance involves the integration of both MEK @- and PI3K @-@ dependent signaling pathways .

AZD6244 could inhibit the tumor growth of NCI-H1993 , but slightly inhibit the tumor growth of NCI-1975 and NCI-H460 .
Combining AZD6244 with BEZ235 markedly enhanced their antitumor effects and without any marked adverse events .
Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining revealed that AZD6244 alone reduced ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation , angiogenesis , and tumor cell proliferation .
Moreover , MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibition resulted in decreased AKT phosphorylation in NCI-H1993 tumor model .
BEZ235 also inhibited AKT phosphorylation as well as their downstream molecules in all three tumor models .
The antiangiogenic effects were substantially enhanced when the agents were combined , which may due to the reduced expression of matrix metallopeptidase-9 in tumor tissues ( MMP-9 ) .

Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay in cells treated with 0 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 100 μM of AZD6244 or BEZ235 for 72 h .
The results showed that AZD6244 significantly suppressed the growth of NCI-H1993 with a low micromolar IC50 value of 5.6 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .

Both AZD6244 and BEZ235 were introduced to cell cultures at 0.25×, 0.5×, 1×, 2× and 4× their respective IC50 s in NCI-H1993 , NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cell lines for 72 h .
Cell growth in all cell lines was markedly decreased following combination treatment at multiple paired concentrations when compared with either single agent alone .
The cells viability data were processed to get the CI under the corresponding effective dose ( ED ) in NCI-H1993 , NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ) by CalcuSyn software .
For the NCI-H1993 cell line the following CI value was obtained : 0.4101 ( ED50 ) .
For NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cell line the CI values were 0.02052 ( ED50 ) , and 0.0440 ( ED50 ) respectively .
The CI results suggested that AZD6244 and BEZ235 worked synergistically to produce an anti @-@ proliferative effect in NCI-H1993 , NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 cell lines ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref>@ A-C ) .

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A-C , treatment with AZD6244 for 3 weeks was able to inhibit tumor growth of NCI-H1993 ( T/C value 40 % ) , but slightly inhibit tumor growth in both NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 subcutaneous tumor models ( T/C values 60 % and 65 % ) , whereas BEZ235 treatment caused an approximately 50 % reduction in tumor growth in all three subcutaneous tumor models .
In contrast , the combined treatments with the two drugs almost completely inhibited NCI-H1993 , NCI-H1975 and NCI-H460 tumor growth at the end of the 3 weeks of therapy ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref>@ A-D ) .

<sec-title level="2"> Effect of MEK and PIK3 @/@ mTOR inhibitors on signaling transduction pathways in gefitinib @-@ resistant NSCLC tumor models </sec-title>
To assess the impact of both compounds on downstream molecules of the MEK and PI3K pathways , we used Western blot analysis to observe phosphorylation status and total protein expression in tumor tissues .
The results showed that p-MEK1 @/@ p-MEK2 , p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 , p-AKT , p-S6 and p-4E-BP1 appeared to be inhibited by AZD6244 and BEZ235 combination treatment , whereas the total protein levels of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 , ERK1 @/@ ERK2 , AKT , S6 and 4E-BP1 remained unchanged in each tumor model ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) .
Western blot analysis of downstream signals also showed treatment with AZD6244 or BEZ235 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 or AKT in all three tumor models respectively .
In addition , combined treatment with AZD6244 and BEZ235 showed greater inhibition of p-ERK1 @/@ p-ERK2 and p-AKT than observed in control group or mice treated with each compound alone <i> in vivo </i> ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) .
Interestingly , the impact from both inhibitors on p-S6 and p-4E-BP1 levels was , alternatively , tumor model specific .
For example , AZD6244 and BEZ235 alone and in combination markedly inhibited p-S6 and p-4E-BP1 expression levels in NCI-H1993 tumor models , compared with the minimal suppression observed in NCI-H460 tumor model ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ) .
Neither AZD6244 nor BEZ235 alone suppressed p-S6 and p-4E-BP1 in NCI-H1975 tumor model .

We observed active cell proliferation in NCI-H1993 tumor model , with a 56 % proliferation index ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ A ) .
Monotherapy with AZD6244 or BEZ235 slightly decreased the percentage of Ki-67 @-@ positive proliferating tumor tissues , with proliferation indices of 42 % and 39 % , respectively ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref>@ A ) .
Combined treatment with AZD6244 and BEZ235 markedly decreased the percentage of Ki-67 @-@ positive proliferating tumor tissues to 10 % , consistent with the marked inhibition of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and AKT phosphorylation .

Selective inhibition of RET mediated cell proliferation in vitro by the kinase inhibitor SPP86 ( PMID : 25409876 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
SPP86 inhibited MAPK signaling and proliferation in RET @/@ PTC1 expressing TPC1 but not 8505C or C643 cells .
In TPC1 cells , the inhibition of RET phosphorylation required co-exposure to SPP86 and the focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) inhibitor PF573228 .
In MCF7 cells , SPP86 inhibited RET @- induced phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases ( PI3K ) / Akt and MAPK signaling and estrogen receptorα ( ERα ) phosphorylation , and inhibited proliferation to a similar degree as tamoxifen .
Interestingly , SPP86 and PF573228 inhibited RET @/@ PTC1 and GDNF @- RET induced activation of Akt and MAPK signaling to a similar degree .
<sec-title level="1"> Results </sec-title>
We investigated the effect of SPP86 on ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in thyroid cancer derived cell lines expressing the RET @/@ PTC1 rearrangement ( TPC1 ) , BRAF @<sup> V600E </sup> ( 8505C ) or RAS @<sup> G13R </sup> ( C643 ) mutations [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47"> 47 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48"> 48 </xref>@ ] .
These mutations have previously been shown to induce constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in these cell lines [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47"> 47 </xref>@ – @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49"> 49 </xref>@ ] .
Since TPC1 but not 8505C and C643 cells depend predominantly on RET @/@ PTC1 signaling for proliferation , we hypothesized that SPP86 should only inhibit the proliferation of the former .
Sorafenib , which inhibits both RET and RAF family kinases , was used as an internal control in these experiments .
<sec-title level="2"> SPP86 inhibits MAPK pathway activation in RET @/@ PTC1 expressing cell lines </sec-title>
As previously reported [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45"> 45 </xref>@ ] , SPP86 effectively inhibits ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in TPC1 cells expressing the RET @/@ PTC1 rearrangement at a concentration of 1 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .
In contrast , SPP86 had no effect on ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in 8505C or C643 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ B and C ) .
Sorafenib , which targets both RET and RAF kinases , effectively inhibited ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in TPC1 cells at a concentration of 0.1 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .
Sorafenib ( 10 μM ) also inhibited ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation in 8505C cells , and to a lesser extent in C643 cells consistent with previous reports [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49"> 49 </xref>@ ] ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ B and C ) .
The differential sensitivity of 8505C and C643 cells to SPP86 and sorafenib likely results from the latter ’s effect on RAF signaling [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49"> 49 </xref>@ ] .
Interestingly , SPP86 induced only modest inhibition of RET @/@ PTC1 phosphorylation Tyr1062 at a concentration of 1 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ D ) .
Complete inhibition required 10 μM of SPP86 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ D ) .
Thus , the ability of SPP86 to abolish ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation at 1 μM does not strictly correlate with its inhibition of RET phosphorylation .
Similar observations have previously been reported with the RET inhibitor RPI-1 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"> 28 </xref>@ ] .
SPP86 also inhibited Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 at a concentration of 1.0 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ E and F ) .
Prolonged exposure ( 20 h ) to 0.5 @- 1 μM SPP86 was also associated with a decline in cyclin D1 levels in this cell line ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ E ) .
In contrast , prolonged exposure to SPP86 did not affect ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation or cyclin D1 expression in 8505C and C643 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ G ) .
We noted however , that prolonged exposure to SPP86 ( 0.5 @- 1.0 μM ) was associated with a decrease in Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in C643 in cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ G ) .
C643 cells express wild type RET [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47"> 47 </xref>@ ] .
SPP86 may thus inhibit RET @- mediated Akt activation in this cell line .
These results demonstrate that unlike sorafenib , SPP86 appears to selectively inhibit RET @/@ PTC1 @- activated MAPK signaling in these cell lines .
We next investigated if FAK could maintain RET phosphorylation on Tyr1062 despite the inhibition of RET autophosphorylation by SPP86 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
Exposure to 2.5 μM of the FAK inhibitor PF573228 [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50"> 50 </xref>@ ] alone , did not inhibit RET phosphorylation in TPC1 cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
In contrast , exposure to 2.5 μM of the FAK inhibitor PF573228 in combination with 1 μM SPP86 was sufficient to inhibit RET phosphorylation on Tyr1062 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
Interestingly , PF273228 and SPP86 inhibited Akt and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation to a similar degree ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ B and C ) .
Exposure to PF573288 but not SPP86 was associated with a reduction of FAK Tyr576 phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ B ) .
Neither PF273228 nor SPP86 suppressed Src phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ D ) .
SPP86 inhibited TPC1 cell proliferation more effectively than PF573228 ( 49 % proliferation <i> vs. </i> 77 % ) but no additive effect was observed following co-exposure to both drugs ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ E ) .
Our observations strongly suggested that SPP86 would selectively inhibit RET @- induced proliferation .
We thus compared the effect of sorafenib and SPP86 on the proliferation of TPC1 , 8505C and C643 cells in media containing 0.1 % serum ( i.e. low culture conditions ) .
Under these conditions , signaling pathway activation is predominantly under the control of the respective oncogenes expressed by these cell lines .
C643 and TPC1 cells showed marked differential sensitivity to SPP86 ( IC @<sub> 50 </sub> , 61.5 vs 1.5 μM for C643 and TPC1 cells respectively ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ A ) .
In contrast , 8505C cells grew poorly under low serum conditions ( data not shown ) , but their proliferation was enhanced when exposed to doses of SPP86 from 1 @–@ 10 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ A ) .
Under similar conditions , the IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values for sorafenib were 3.1 μM , 0.28 μM , and 33.3 μM for C643 , TPC1 and 8505C cells respectively ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ B ) .
In general , low doses of SPP86 do not inhibit the activity of signaling proteins downstream of RET or other kinases that directly interact with it [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45"> 45 </xref>@ ] .
SPP86 thus selectively inhibited the proliferation of TPC1 cells dependent on oncogenic RET but not 8505C and C643 cells respectively dependent on oncogenic BRAF and RAS .
<sec-title level="2"> SPP86 inhibits RET signaling in ERα positive breast cancer cells </sec-title>
In addition to its role in thyroid cancers , RET has been shown to functionally interact with ERα in human breast cancer cell lines [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5"> 5 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"> 6 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51"> 51 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52"> 52 </xref>@ ] .
We thus evaluated the utility of using SPP86 to interrogate RET signaling in MCF7 breast cancer cells .
Firstly , we studied the effect of SPP86 on RET @- mediated ERα phosphorylation on serine residue 167 ( Ser167 ) .
Estrogen deprived and serum starved MCF7 cells were exposed to 10 ng @/@ ml GDNF in the absence or presence of increasing does of SPP86 .
In these experiments , SPP86 effectively inhibited GDNF @/@ RET @- induced ERα phosphorylation at a concentration of 0.1 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ A ) .
Higher concentrations of SPP86 , 1 @–@ 10 μM , reduced ERα phosphorylation even below baseline levels .
In addition , exposure of MCF7 cells to SPP86 was associated with a moderate decrease in ERα levels in these experiments ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ A ) We next investigated the effect of SPP86 on RET @- mediated activation of these pathways in MCF7 cells .
SPP86 inhibited GDNF @/@ RET @- induced phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream signaling at concentrations as low as 0.1 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ B ) .
We noted that SPP86 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt more effectively than that of its downstream target p70S6K at this concentration .
Similarly , SPP86 inhibited Akt phosphorylation at markedly lower concentrations than those required to inhibit MAPK phosphorylation ( 0.1 vs. 1.0 μM ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ B ) .
SPP86 effectively inhibited GDNF @- induced RET phosphorylation Tyr1062 at a concentration of 1.0 μM .
In contrast , FAK inhibition with PF573228 only moderately inhibited RET phosphorylation .
Co @- exposure to PF573228 and SPP86 however , exerted an additive inhibitory effect on RET phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ C ) .
Both PF573228 and SPP86 inhibited GDNF @- induced ERK1 @/@ ERK2 and Akt phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ C and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1"> 1 </xref>@ A ) .
Prolonged exposure of MCF7 cells to SPP86 also lead to the suppression of cyclin D1 expression ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ D ) .
We next compared the effects of sorafenib and SPP86 on PI3K @/@ Akt and MAPK pathway signaling , with a view to discriminate the direct effects of RET inhibition from those of a combined inhibition of RET and RAF .
In these experiments , estrogen deprived and serum starved MCF7 cells were exposed to 10 ng @/@ ml GDNF alone or in the presence of either sorafenib or SPP86 .
Analyses of the relative levels of phosphorylated Akt and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 demonstrated that both compounds effectively block GDNF @- induced RET signaling at concentrations as low as 1 μM ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ E ) .
We noted however , that sorafenib inhibited Akt and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 slightly more effectively than SPP86 under these conditions ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ E ) .
These differential effects on PI3K @/@ Akt and MAPK signaling may result may stem from the fact that sorafenib and SPP86 target different kinases at low concentrations .
The enhanced inhibition of MAPK signaling observed with sorafenib may also result from the fact that it targets both RET and RAF family kinases [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37"> 37 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45"> 45 </xref>@ ] .
Since these observations suggested that SPP86 disrupts ERα @- RET crosstalk , we investigated the effect of SPP86 on the proliferation of MCF7 cells .
Estrogen deprived and serum starved cells were cultured in the presence of 1 ng @/@ ml β @- estradiol ( E2 ) or 10 ng @/@ ml GDNF alone and in combination in the presence of 1 μM SPP86 for 7 days .
SPP86 effectively inhibited E2 and @/@ or GDNF @- induced proliferation ( <i> p </i> < 0.05 ) ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ A ) .
In contrast , SPP86 did not inhibit proliferation when MCF7 cells were co-exposed to 1 ng @/@ ml E2 and 5 ng @/@ insulin under similar conditions ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ B ) .
We next compared the effect of SPP86 and tamoxifen on the proliferation of MCF7 cells .
Estrogen deprived and serum starved cells were cultured in the presence of 1 ng @/@ ml β @- estradiol ( E2 ) and 10 ng @/@ ml GDNF with increasing doses of either SPP86 or tamoxifen , in medium containing 1 ng @/@ ml β @- estradiol ( E2 ) and 10 ng @/@ ml GDNF and incubated for 7 days .
In these experiments , SPP86 and tamoxifen inhibited proliferation to a similar degree with IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values of 1.0 and 1.4 μM respectively ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ C ) .
Constitutive activation of the ERK pathway in melanoma and skin melanocytes in Grey horses ( PMID : 25413220 )
<sec-title level="1" sec-area="abstract"> Results </sec-title>
We found that the ERK pathway is constitutively activated in Grey horse melanoma tumours and cell lines in the absence of somatic activating mutations in <i> BRAF </i> , <i> RAS </i> , <i> GNAQ </i> , <i> GNA11 </i> and <i> KIT </i> genes or alterations in the expression of the main components of the pathway .
The pathway is mitogenic and is mediated by BRAF , CRAF and KRAS kinases .
Importantly , we found high activation of the ERK pathway also in epidermal melanocytes , suggesting a general predisposition to melanomagenesis in these horses .

<sec-title level="2"> ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in Grey horse melanomas </sec-title>
Given the importance of the MAPK @/@ ERK pathway activation in melanoma development , we examined the levels of the activated ( phosphorylated ) ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 ) in primary cutaneous melanoma tumours from Grey ( n = 19 ) and non @-@ Grey ( n = 12 ) horses of different breeds from three geographic locations across Europe by indirect immunofluorescence , using an anti @-@ MITF antibody to mark melanocytic lineage [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23"> 23 </xref>@ ] .
All the tumours expressed nuclear and occasionally cytoplasmic P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 , however , both signals were by far more abundant in the GHM samples ( 80.2 % ± 8.5 <i> vs </i>@ . 7.6 % ± 21.3 in Grey and non @-@ grey MITF @<sup> + </sup> cells , respectively ; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ A , B ) .
Although non @-@ grey melanomas were much more heterogeneous for the P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 staining than the Grey counterparts , the quantitative difference between the signals reached statistical significance ( <i> P </i> < 0.001 ) .
The total ERK1 @/@ ERK2 signal was similarly heterogeneous in both Grey and non @-@ grey samples ( 71.2 ± 17.4 <i> vs </i>@ . 50.5 % ± 13.0 in MITF @<sup> + </sup> cells of the respective melanoma type ; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ A , B ) .
In line with the elevated P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 levels in the GHM tissues , high P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 levels were detected in two GHM cell lines , HoMel @-@ L1 and HoMel-A1 , established from a primary and metastatic melanoma tumour of a Grey Lipizzaner and Arabian horse , respectively [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24"> 24 </xref>@ ] .
The P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 levels were comparable to those seen in human melanoma cell lines with oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutations , in contrast to a cell line with wild-type BRAF and NRAS ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ C , D ; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1"> 1 </xref> ) .
ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was activated even in the absence of serum and serum addition had a minimal stimulatory effect on the P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 levels ( Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2"> 2 </xref>@ : Figure S1A , B ) .
<sec-title level="2"> MEK @/@ ERK module is required for growth of Grey horse melanoma cells </sec-title>
To assess the involvement of the ERK pathway in proliferation of the GHM cells , we treated the HoMel @-@ L1 and HoMel-A1 cell lines with U0126 , a specific inhibitor of MEK1 @/@ MEK2 and therefore ERK phosphorylation .
Western blot analysis showed an expected decrease in P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 in both cell lines upon the treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ A ) .
The treatment also largely reduced cell viability in both cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ B ) .
As judged from the calculated IC @<sub> 50 </sub> values , HoMel @-@ L1 appeared more sensitive to the MEK1 @/@ MEK2 inhibition than HoMel-A1 ( P < 0.05 ) and at least as sensitive as the human <sup> Q61R </sup>@ NRAS line BL ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ C ) .
Both GHM cell lines were less sensitive to the U0126 treatment than the human <sup> V600E </sup>@ BRAF line Mel @-@ Ho , although , this did not reach statistical significance for HoMel @-@ L1 .
In contrast , cell viability of the human <sup> WT </sup>@ BRAF <sup> WT </sup>@ RAS line M5 was only weakly inhibited by the treatment ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2"> 2 </xref>@ B ) .
These results demonstrate that ERK signaling is an important component for GHM cell growth ; however the incomplete inhibition by U0126 suggests that additional ERK @-@ independent mechanisms are involved .
<sec-title level="2"> Activation of ERK pathway in Grey horse melanoma cells is not linked to common oncogenic alterations </sec-title>
To test whether the constitutive ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation was due to the presence of oncogenic mutations commonly associated with ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in melanocytic neoplasms , we screened the horse cell lines and seven additional GHM tumours for mutations in exons 11 and 15 of <i> BRAF </i> , the full coding regions of <i> N </i>@ -, <i> K </i>@ - and <i> HRAS </i> , exon 4 and 5 of <i> GNAQ </i> and <i> GNA11 </i> , and exons 9 @–@ 21 of <i> KIT </i>@ .
In all the genes except <i> KIT </i> , no mutations were found , indicating the wild-type status of the genes in this melanoma type .
In <i> KIT </i> , four single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were found in exon 14 , 15 , 19 and 20 ( 11 % each ) in each of 4 different tumours ( Table  @<xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2"> 2 </xref> ) .
However , these SNPs were silent on the protein level and present in the constitutional DNA from both Grey and non @-@ Grey horses of different breeds ( Table  @<xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2"> 2 </xref> ) , and therefore were considered as common germline polymorphisms with no link to the Grey phenotype .
Another possible mechanism for a constitutive activation of the ERK pathway may involve overexpression of a component of the pathway or underexpression of its negative regulator .
To address this possibility we compared expression levels of the key kinases and two major negative regulators of the pathway , SPROUTY2 and RKIP , in the GHM <i> vs </i>@ . human melanoma cell lines with activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 due to oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutations .
We found no substantial differences in the levels of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1"> 1 </xref>@ C ) , MEK1 @/@ MEK2 , BRAF , NRAS ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ A and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figure S2A ) between the horse and human melanoma cells .
The levels of SPROUTY2 and RKIP in the horse lines were not lower than those in the human lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ A and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figure S2A ) .
Together , these results suggest that neither oncogenic mutations in the components of the ERK pathway nor alteration in their expression or of that of the pathway ’s major negative regulators is likely to be responsible for the constitutive activation of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in GHM cells .
<sec-title level="2"> ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation is BRAF , CRAF and KRAS @-@ dependent in Grey horse melanoma cells </sec-title>
In order to identify upstream signaling components involved in the constitutive ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation in GHM cells we used specific inhibitors against RAF ( L779450 ) , RAS ( farnesyl thiosalicylic acid , FTS ) and PI3K @/@ AKT ( LY294002 ) proteins .
Only the L779450 treatment was able to reduce P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 levels , suggesting involvement of RAF kinases in the control of ERK activation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ B and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3"> 3 </xref>@ : Figure S2B ; FTS treatment not shown ) .
The treatment attenuated cell growth in both cell lines ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3"> 3 </xref>@ C , D ) to the levels comparable to those attained by the U0126 treatment , supporting a role of RAF kinases in GHM cell growth through ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation .
We also examined the contribution of individual RAF isoforms on ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation by RNA silencing ( siRNA ) .
While no considerable reduction in ERK1 @/@ ERK2 activation was achieved by ARAF depletion , BRAF and CRAF silencing each reduced the level of ERK1 @/@ ERK2 phosphorylation ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4"> 4 </xref>@ A-E ) .
Since RAS kinases are known upstream activators of wild-type RAF kinases , the failure of the FTS treatment to affect the P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 levels was somewhat unexpected .
We therefore decided to directly manipulate the levels of RAS kinases by siRNA @-@ based approach to address their potential contribution to the ERK1 @/@ ERK2 pathway in GHM cells .
The initial experiment with combined depletion of NRAS , HRAS and KRAS indicated their involvement in the signaling ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ B , C left panels ) .
Further investigation of individual contribution of the RAS isoforms indicated KRAS as major RAS activator of the ERK signaling in these cells ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5"> 5 </xref>@ B-E ) .
<sec-title level="2"> ERK pathway is activated already in skin melanocytes of Grey horses </sec-title>
The absence of the oncogenic mutations commonly linked to the activation of the ERK pathway in melanomas , the strong association of the <i> Grey </i> mutation with the melanoma predisposition [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17"> 17 </xref>@ ] and the notion that the <i> Grey </i> mutation has an effect throughout melanocyte development [ @<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18"> 18 </xref>@ ] , prompted us to test if the ERK pathway was already activated at the level of normal skin melanocytes in Grey horses .
We analyzed expression of both phosphorylated and total ERK1 @/@ ERK2 in skin samples from Grey ( <i> n </i> = 9 ) <i> vs </i>@ . non @-@ grey horses ( <i> n </i> = 12 ) of different breeds from the same and different geographic locations , as was done for the melanoma samples .
A high percentage of MITF @<sup> + </sup> epidermal melanocytes positive for the P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 was detected in all Grey horse skins ( 75.8 % ± 10.0 ) in sharp contrast to non @-@ grey horse skins , where the phosphorylated ERK was absent ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6"> 6 </xref>@ A , B ) .
The activated ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was detected both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in Grey melanocytes .
Percentage of the total ERK1 @/@ ERK2 positive cells was 99.5 % ± 0.5 in Grey and 77.1 % ± 11.3 in non @-@ grey skins ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6"> 6 </xref>@ A , B ) .
Interestingly , keratinocytes from Grey but not non @-@ grey horses were also positive for P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 ( Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6"> 6 </xref>@ A ) .
The staining pattern of both P-ERK1 @/@ P-ERK2 and ERK1 @/@ ERK2 was highly reproducible in samples coming from different studs and prepared in different laboratories .
