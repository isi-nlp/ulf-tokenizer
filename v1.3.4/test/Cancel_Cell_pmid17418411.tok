a3_pmid_1741_8411.2 <sec-title level="0" sec-area="abstract"> Summary </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.3 Multiple myeloma ( MM ) evolves from a highly prevalent premalignant condition termed MGUS .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.4 The factors underlying the malignant transformation of MGUS are unknown .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.5 We report a MGUS @/@ MM phenotype in transgenic mice with <i> Eμ </i>@ -@ directed expression of the XBP-1 spliced isoform ( XBP-1s ) , a factor governing unfolded protein @/@ ER stress response and plasma @-@ cell development .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.6 Eμ-XBP-1s elicited elevated serum Ig and skin alterations .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.7 With age , <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenics develop features diagnostic of human MM , including bone lytic lesions and subendothelial Ig deposition .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.8 Furthermore , transcriptional profiles of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> lymphoid and MM cells show aberrant expression of known human MM dysregulated genes .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.9 The similarities of this model with the human disease , coupled with documented frequent XBP-1s overexpression in human MM , serve to implicate XBP-1s dysregulation in MM pathogenesis .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.10 <sec-title level="1"> SIGNIFICANCE </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.11 <bold> The significance of this work is underscored by the presence of MGUS in 1 % @–@ 10 % of adults , with 1 % @–@ 3 % progressing to MM annually .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.12 The genesis and progression of the disease are poorly understood , and the generation of a mouse model recapitulating many aspects of MGUS and MM provides an opportunity for the systematic dissection of the biological processes underlying disease progression .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.13 In particular , this genetically engineered MM @-@ prone model enables validation of emerging MM @-@ relevant ( epi ) genetic alterations and guides development of effective therapies targeting such validated rate @-@ limiting aberrations .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.14 This genetic study and analysis of clinical samples suggest a pathogenetic role for sustained XBP-1s expression in the neoplastic transformation of plasma cells , indicating that chronic cellular stress contributes to the development of this common neoplasm . </bold>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.15 <sec-title level="1"> Introduction </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.16 Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a multifocal plasma @-@ cell neoplasm characterized by serum monoclonal gammopathy and focal skeletal lesions .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.17 MM is preceded by a premalignant condition , <i> m </i>@ onoclonal <i> g </i>@ ammopathy of <i> u </i>@ ndetermined <i> s </i>@ ignificance ( MGUS ) , present in 1 % of adults over the age of 25 and rising to 10 % prevalence in individuals in their tenth decade .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.18 The genetic and environmental factors underlying MGUS and its progression to MM are largely unknown , although aberrant physiological responses to chronic immune stimulation are among the number of potential pathogenetic associations ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"> Sirohi and Powles , 2006 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.19 MM remains incurable despite conventional high @-@ dose chemotherapy and transplantation , translating into a median survival of 6 years ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib25"> Bergsagel and Kuehl , 2005 ; Mitsiades et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.20 Extensive genomic analysis has revealed a large number of genes and loci associated with the development of MGUS and MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.21 Prominent cytogenetic events include chromosomal translocations involving Ig loci juxtaposed to the genes <i> Cyclin D1 </i> , <i> FGFR3 </i> , <i> MMSET </i> , and <i> c-MAF </i> , driving their overexpression .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.22 Additional genetic events typically associated with disease progression include <i> Ras </i> and <i> FGFR3 </i> activating mutations ; <i> c-MYC </i> deregulation ; <i> p16INK4A </i> , <i> p18INK4C </i> , <i> TP53 </i> , and <i> PTEN </i> tumor suppressor gene inactivation ; and chromosome 13 deletion ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib17"> Bergsagel and Kuehl , 2005 ; Kuehl and Bergsagel , 2002 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.23 Recent genomic studies have provided evidence of many additional genetic lesions driving human MM pathogenesis ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"> Carrasco et al. , 2006 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.24 The availability of a MM mouse model would facilitate the identification and validation of these MM @-@ relevant genes and provide a preclinical model for assessing therapeutic agents directed against such targets .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.25 Many experimental efforts to generate mouse models of B cell neoplasms , including MM , have typically involved targeted oncogene expression in the B cell compartment by transgenic and knockin approaches , alone or together with various tumor suppressor gene mutations ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5 bib28"> Cheung et al. , 2004 ; Park et al. , 2005 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.26 These modeling strategies have generally yielded B cell malignancies displaying immature phenotypes or plasmacytomas rather than classical MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.27 It is worth noting that mice do possess the inherent capacity to develop a spontaneous condition similar to human MGUS and MM , as evidenced by the capacity of the C57BL @/@ KaLwRij strain to develop a plasma @-@ cell dyscrasia , monoclonal gammopathy , and bone lytic lesions , albeit with late onset ( after 2 years ) , low incidence ( 0.5 % ) , and a propensity of these malignant plasma cells to home to lymphoid tissues other than the bone marrow ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"> Garrett et al. , 1997 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.28 Furthermore , the intravenous transplantation of these myeloma cells into syngeneic hosts has generated a single cell @-@ line model that generates characteristic myeloma bone disease ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"> Garrett et al. , 1997 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.29 Along the lines of disease representation , it is worth noting that human MM consists of a minimum of four molecular subtypes ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"> Carrasco et al. , 2006 </xref> ) and that available human MM cell lines only partially represent these disease categories ( D.R.C. , G.T. , and R.A.D. , unpublished data ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.30 Together , these observations underscore the need for the continued development of genetic and cell @-@ line models that capture the full range of genetic and biological diversity of human MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.31 Based upon the above efforts to construct MM mouse models , we hypothesized that enforced B cell lineage @-@ directed transgene expression of factors driving plasma @-@ cell differentiation , alone or together with classical myeloma genes , would enhance the development of a MM @-@ like disease .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.32 XBP-1 is a basic @-@ region leucine zipper ( bZIP ) transcription factor of the CREB @-@ ATF family and a major regulator of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and plasma @-@ cell differentiation .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.33 XBP-1 @-@ deficient embryos die in utero from severe liver hypoplasia and resultant fatal anemia .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.34 Viable chimeras derived from XBP-1 null ES cells injected into Rag2 blastocysts reveal that XBP-1 @-@ deficient B cells proliferate and form germinal centers , yet there is a profound impairment in Ig secretion and absence of plasma cells ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"> Reimold et al. , 2001 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.35 XBP-1 is subject to alternative RNA processing , generating two mRNA transcripts encoding the same N-terminal DNA binding domain , but different C-terminal transactivation domains .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.36 The shorter spliced transcript , designated XBP-1s , possesses enhanced transactivation potential and stability relative to the product of the unspliced transcript , designated XBP-1u ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15 bib20 bib33"> Iwakoshi et al. , 2003b ; Lee et al. , 2002 ; Shen et al. , 2001 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.37 Thus , XBP-1u has no appreciable transactivation potential and may function as a dominant negative of XBP-1s ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"> Lee et al. , 2003 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.38 Recent studies have uncovered several functions for XBP-1 and have implicated XBP-1 overexpression in human carcinogenesis and tumor growth under hypoxic conditions .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.39 Specifically , elevated XBP-1 mRNA levels have been detected in hepatocellular carcinomas ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"> Lee et al. , 2002 </xref> ) and in primary ERα @-@ positive breast tumors ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8 bib14"> Fujimoto et al. , 2003 ; Iwakoshi et al. , 2003a </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.40 With regard to MM , abundant expression of XBP-1 has been detected in human MM cells ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26"> Munshi et al. , 2004 </xref> ) and can be induced by IL-6 , a growth factor for malignant plasma cells ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"> Wen et al. , 1999 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.41 However , these studies did not provide definitive documentation of the particular XBP-1 isoform preferentially produced in human MM or provide insights into the pathophysiological relevance of these XBP-1 isoforms in MGUS and MM ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6 bib26"> Davies et al. , 2003 ; Munshi et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.42 In this study , we have explored the biological impact of sustained XBP-1s expression in the lymphoid system , anticipating that this genetic event would be a necessary component along with other MM @-@ relevant oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene manipulations to generate a MM @-@ prone mouse model .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.43 Unexpectedly , XBP-1s overexpression alone yielded a MGUS @-@ MM disease bearing many features that are classic hallmarks of the human disease on the clinical , pathological , and molecular levels .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.44 These genetic observations were bolstered by an analysis of clinical samples documenting frequent XBP-1s overexpression in human MM samples relative to normal plasma cells , together implicating XBP-1s dysregulation in the genesis of this malignancy .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.45 This murine model of MGUS @-@ MM provides a framework for understanding the molecular and biological mechanisms governing the genesis and progression of these common and enigmatic plasma @-@ cell dyscrasias .

a3_pmid_1741_8411.47 <sec-title level="2"> XBP-1 Expression in Human Normal Plasma Cells and MM Cells </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.48 The unanticipated MM @-@ prone condition in our mouse model ( see below ) and previous studies documenting increased XBP-1 expression in human MM ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6 bib26"> Davies et al. , 2003 ; Munshi et al. , 2004 </xref> ) prompted detailed XBP-1 expression studies in clinical samples .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.49 Tissue microarray immunohistochemical ( TMA @-@ IHC ) and western blot assays were used to examine the relative levels and patterns of XBP-1 and its isoforms in normal human plasma cells , MGUS , and MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.50 As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1 </xref>@ A , TMA @-@ IHC analysis of bone marrow tissues derived from healthy donors and from MGUS and MM patients revealed low or undetectable XBP-1 protein expression in the plasma cells from ten healthy donors yet robust and widespread XBP-1 expression in 10 @/@ 20 ( 50 % ) of MGUS and 50 @/@ 70 ( 70 % ) of MM samples .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.51 Consistent with the IHC data , western blot analysis of protein extracts from 22 samples of CD138 @<sup> + </sup> MM cells demonstrated a prominent shift toward increased XBP-1s expression in the majority of MM primary tumor samples relative to normal plasma cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1 </xref>@ B and 1C ) , a pattern also evident in MM cell lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figures 1 </xref>@ C–1E ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.52 These correlative translational observations and the known capacity of XBP-1 to drive expression of MM @-@ promoting factors such as IL-6 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"> Iwakoshi et al. , 2003b </xref> and see below ) prompts speculation that chronically increased levels of XBP-1s may contribute to the development of human MGUS and MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.53 <sec-title level="2"> Generation of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> Transgenic Mice Expressing XBP-1s in B Cells and Plasma Cells </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.54 On the basis of XBP-1s prominence in human MM and its potent transactivation potential ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"> Iwakoshi et al. , 2003a </xref> ) , we generated and characterized transgenic mice engineered to express the <i> xbp-1s </i> open reading frame under the control of the immunoglobulin <i> V @<sub> H </sub> </i> promoter and <i> Eμ </i> enhancer elements ( Eμ ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ A ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.55 Nine founders were obtained for the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgene , and Southern blot comparison of the endogenous ( WT ) and transgenic <i> xbp-1s </i> hybridization signals ( TG ) indicated transgene copy numbers ranging from approximately 1 to 15 .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.56 The Southern blot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ B documents three of the nine founders in one representative litter derived from C57BL @/@ 6 @-@ microinjected oocytes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ B ; other founder blots not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.57 Two independent founder lines , S.7 and S.9 , and their transgenic progeny , were propagated and used in this study .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.58 In accord with the known capacity of Eμ regulatory elements to drive transgene expression throughout B cell development , as well as in some T cells ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"> Kemp et al. , 1980 </xref> ) , robust <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgene expression was detected in the spleen , lymph nodes , thymus , and bone marrow of all nine founders , including S.7 and S.9 progeny , as determined by eGFP expression ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ C , only S.7 shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.59 Analysis of purified splenic B cells using the pan-B cell marker B220 from 6 @-@ week @-@ old <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic and control mice showed increased levels of the spliced <i> xbp-1s </i> transcript in the transgenic mice correlating with transgene DNA copy number ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ D and data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.60 Correspondingly , western blot analysis of B220 @<sup> + </sup> splenic B cells confirmed elevated XBP-1s protein levels ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ E ) , and anti @-@ XBP-1 immunofluorescence showed stronger nuclear staining in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic B cells compared with nontransgenic B cell controls ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref>@ F ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.61 Together , these assays documented increased XBP-1s protein levels in the murine B lineage , enabling an in vivo analysis of the functional impact of enforced XBP-1s expression in B cell and plasma @-@ cell compartments .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.62 To that end , all nine founders and the S.7 and S.9 progeny were assessed clinically using histological and flow cytometric analysis of lymphoid cells .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.63 While detailed phenotypic analysis described below focused on the two independent transgenic lines , S.7 and S.9 , and their progeny , the same phenotype was observed in all nine founders .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.64 <sec-title level="2"> <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> Transgenic Mice Show Cutaneous and Renal Pathologies Resembling Patients with Chronic Plasma @-@ Cell Disorders </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.65 Through 20 weeks of age , <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice exhibited normal gross appearance , behavior , and weight curves .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.66 Histological surveys of the major organs , as well as flow cytometric profiles of spleens using the lymphoid cells markers CD3 and B220 , did not demonstrate any abnormalities ( data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.67 By approximately 40 weeks of age , <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic animals began to manifest phenotypic changes in the skin and kidneys .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.68 <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice exhibited an overall shortened life span resulting from severe cutaneous disease and @/@ or myeloma ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ A ; see below ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.69 Sixty percent of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice developed hair loss and skin thickening around axillary and neck regions , whereas control littermates were unaffected ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ B and data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.70 This cutaneous presentation was observed in all independently derived <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic lines .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.71 Histological examination of the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> skin revealed epidermal thickening and some degree of hyperkeratosis with follicular plugging as well as dermal fibrosis with mild lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and vascular hyperplasia .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.72 It is notable that these pathological changes are similar to those encountered in patients with specific autoimmune conditions and a rare plasma @-@ cell disorder , termed POEMS ( for <i> p </i>@ olyneuropathy , <i> o </i>@ rganomegaly , <i> e </i>@ ndocrinopathy , serum <i> m </i>@ onoclonal protein , and <i> s </i>@ kin lesions ) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"> Dispenzieri , 2005 </xref> ) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ B ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.73 By 40 weeks , <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice also showed renal pathology , including tubular cast deposition ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ C , white arrows ) and glomerular changes characterized by mesangial widening and deposition of PAS @-@ positive material ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ C , yellow arrows ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.74 Transmission electron microscopy showed mesangial and subendothelial deposition of electron @-@ dense material ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ C , black arrows ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.75 These renal lesions are similar to the pathologic manifestations present in human MM and other plasma @-@ cell disorders with systemic chronic Ig overproduction and accumulation of light chains ( light @-@ chain cast nephropathy ) , paraproteins , and other Ig fragments ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"> Herrera et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.76 To assess whether these lesions were Ig deposits , immunofluorescence with antibodies specific for light @- and heavy @-@ chain Ig was performed .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.77 Nonspecific trapping of light @- and heavy @-@ chain Ig was present and consisted of either polyclonal heavy and light chains or clonal IgM or IgG heavy chain and kappa light chains ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref>@ D and data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.78 To determine whether amyloid depositions were present , a feature occasionally seen in MM patients , Congo red stains performed across several tissues and independent cell lines were negative ( see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S1 </xref>@ A in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Supplemental Data </xref> available with this article online ) suggesting that amyloid deposition , which is observed rarely ( 5 % @–@ 15 % ) in human MM patients ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"> Kyle and Gertz , 1990 </xref> ) , is not a feature of the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> disease model .

a3_pmid_1741_8411.80 Serial gross , histological , and flow cytometric examination of the spleen and bone marrow of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice showed alterations after 20 @–@ 40 weeks of age .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.81 The spleens appeared slightly enlarged and showed increased plasma cells around periarterial sheaths ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S1 </xref>@ B , arrows ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.82 Flow cytometric analysis showed unaltered total numbers of T cell ( CD3 ) and B cell ( B220 ) populations in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic spleens ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S2 </xref>@ A ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.83 The total number of mononuclear cells between wild-type ( 8.05 × 10 @<sup> 7 </sup> ± 0.5 ) and <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic ( 7.95 × 10 @<sup> 7 </sup> ± 1.5 ) spleens did not differ .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.84 <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice at 40 weeks of age showed a slightly enlarged population of CD23 @<sup> + </sup> cells ( 49.1 % ± 3.9 % versus 40.2 % ± 0.1 % ) and a reciprocal decrease in CD23 @<sup> − </sup> cells ( 43.3 % ± 1.5 % versus 53.4 % ± 1.9 % ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.85 We observed a trend toward increased number of precursor and mature follicular cells T2 @/@ M cells ( CD23 @<sup> + </sup>@ /CD21 @<sup> + </sup>@ /IgM @<sup> + </sup> cells ) ( 34.1 % ± 1.2 % versus 26.4 % ± 1.4 % ) as well as marginal zone ( MZ ) B cells ( CD23 @<sup> − </sup>@ IgM @<sup> hi </sup>@ CD21 @<sup> + </sup> cells ) ( 3 % ± 0.1 % versus 1 % ± 0.0 % ) in the spleens of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S2 </xref>@ B ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.86 In addition , the fraction of B220 @<sup> + </sup> cells in the bone marrow was significantly increased in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice with an increase in the mature IgM @<sup> + </sup>@ B220 @<sup> + </sup> B cell population ( 17.2 % ± 1.2 % versus 10.8 % ± 0.2 % ) and a relative decrease of pro-B cells ( B220 @<sup> + </sup>@ CD43 @<sup> + </sup> ) in relation to pre @-@ B cells ( B220 @<sup> low </sup>@ CD43 @<sup> − </sup> ) in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic bone marrows ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S2 </xref>@ B ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.87 Overall , these studies reinforce the view that enforced XBP-1s expression has an impact beyond the well @-@ established role of this transcription factor in the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"> Shaffer et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.88 Consistent with the above observation of expanded B cell compartment , plasma immunoglobulin levels of both IgM and IgG types by ELISA were significantly increased in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref>@ A ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.89 Serum protein electrophoresis ( SPEP ) revealed presence of an M spike ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4 </xref>@ A , arrow ) in the majority of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice , but not in control littermates as early as 20 weeks of age—a feature that increased in frequency and magnitude with advancing age ( data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.90 Notably , these serum changes were associated in some cases with bone lytic lesions and increased numbers of plasma cells in the bone marrow that varied from 5 % @–@ 30 % of the total bone marrow cellularity compared with &lt; 5 % for nontransgenic controls ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> 4 </xref>@ B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> 5 </xref>@ A ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Table S1 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.91 On the molecular level , transcriptome comparison of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> and nontransgenic B cells ( n = 5 mice each ) by <i> s </i>@ ignificance <i> a </i>@ nalysis of <i> m </i>@ icroarrays ( SAM ) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38"> Tusher et al. , 2001 </xref> ) revealed 1119 genes that were differentially expressed ( false discovery rate [ FDR ] = 1 % ) , 808 upregulated and 311 downregulated in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> B cells versus nontransgenic B cells .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.92 Among the genes selectively altered in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> B cells are those with known relevance to human MM pathogenesis , such as Cyclin D1 , Cyclin D2 , MAF , and MAFB ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6 </xref>@ A and data not shown ) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17 bib31"> Kuehl and Bergsagel , 2002 ; Shaffer et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.93 Given the role of these genes in cell @-@ cycle regulation , proliferative potential of wild-type and transgenic B cells were examined ex vivo .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.94 Consistent with the molecular changes , <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic B cells exhibited increased incorporation of thymidine relative to nontransgenic controls ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S2 </xref>@ C , p = 0.002 ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.95 Enhanced proliferative potential of the transgenic B cells was also observed in response to stimulation with B cell activators CD40 , anti @-@ IgM , or CD40 together with anti @-@ IgM ( data not shown ) .

a3_pmid_1741_8411.97 A notable MM @-@ relevant pathway that was prominently altered is IL-6 , where the two components of the IL-6 receptor , IL-6R and gp130 , show significant upregulation , along with three members of the CEBP family , CEBPA , CEBPB , and CEBPD , in addition to several downstream targets of these transcriptional factors , such as ALOX5 , LITAF , MMP8 , and IFITM3 ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S3 </xref>@ A ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.98 Prompted by this observation , we examined the level of serum IL-6 , to determine whether a more general dysregulation of this pathway was present in these mice .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.99 Consistent with the activation of this pathway , serum IL-6 levels were increased in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice relative to control littermates ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S2 </xref>@ C , p &lt; 0.005 ) , while the plasma levels of other cytokines , including IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , and IL-10 , were unchanged ( data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.100 Taken together , the phenotypic and molecular analyses of transgenic and nontransgenic B cells uncovered cancer @-@ relevant biological consequences of XBP-1s overexpression , including B cell hyperproliferation and IL-6 activation , both of which are plausible mechanisms capable of driving plasma @-@ cell transformation .

a3_pmid_1741_8411.102 The above constellation of findings prompted detailed analysis of aging <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> and nontransgenic controls for evidence of MGUS and @/@ or MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.103 As early as 40 weeks of age , a classical MGUS profile emerged only in the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.104 Between 11 and 20 months of age , approximately 26 % ( 9 @/@ 35 ) of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice showed a clonal M spike in the serum and expanded populations of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow ( &lt; 10 % of the total bone marrow mononuclear cells ) , without bone lytic lesions and consistent with a pattern of MGUS ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Table S1 </xref> ; data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.105 Between 14 and 24 months of age , 26 % ( 8 @/@ 35 ) of <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice progressed to frank MM as defined by a clonal M spike in the serum , bone marrow consisting of &gt; 10 % of clonal plasma cells , and associated bone lytic lesions on radiographic examination ( Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> 4 </xref>@ A , 4B , and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> 5 </xref>@ A ; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Table S1 </xref> ; and data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.106 Clonality of the MM cells was evidenced by IHC of immunoglobulin heavy and light @-@ chain subtype expression , as performed in the clinical laboratory ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref>@ A ) , and by Southern blot analysis of <i> IgH </i> gene rearrangement analysis in bone marrow plasma cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref>@ B ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.107 In accord with the concept of a postgerminal center cell derivation of human MM cells ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"> Kuehl and Bergsagel , 2002 </xref> ) , some of the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> MMs showed evidence of somatic hypermutation between the body of the 3′ JH4 region of rearranged variable ( V ) genes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref>@ C ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.108 Neither MGUS nor MM was detected in control littermates at any age , indicating that XBP-1s overexpression promotes the development of a condition similar to MGUS and MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.109 In summary , spontaneous progression from MGUS to MM in the <i> Eu @-@ xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice clinically mirrors disease progression in the human .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.110 To further compare this mouse model with the human disease , we performed transcriptome profiling to define the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> myeloma signature .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.111 Transcriptome analyses in the mouse identified 708 genes overexpressed and 1784 genes downregulated ( FDR = 1 % ) in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> MM cells relative to B cells from young neoplasm @-@ free <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> mice .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.112 Supporting a pathogenetic role for XBP-1s overexpression in the myeloma genesis in this model , several known MM genes that were dysregulated in premalignant <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> B cells exhibited similar patterns of alterations in XBP-1s MM cells , including Cyclin D1 , MAF , CEBPA , CEBPB , CEBPD , IL6ST ( upregulated ) , and FOS ( downregulated ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.113 Conversely , some notable MM signature genes were found to be selectively dysregulated in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> MM , but not in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> B cells , in line with the need for additional spontaneously occurring cooperating events as reflected in the long latency of the MM phenotype .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.114 Among such genes selectively upregulated in the tumors were APRIL and BAFF , both of which have been found to be overexpressed in various B cell malignancies , including MM ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12 bib27"> He et al. , 2004 ; Novak et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.115 However , unlike the human counterpart , the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> MM transcriptome revealed evidence of prominent activation of proapoptotic tumor suppression mechanisms characterized by downregulation of the antiapoptotic genes , MCL1 and BCL2 , which are typically upregulated or amplified in aggressive human MM cases ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4 bib19 bib25"> Carrasco et al. , 2006 ; Le Gouill et al. , 2004 ; Mitsiades et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.116 Interestingly , MCL1 and BCL2 were not downregulated in hyperproliferative premalignant transgenic B cells ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S3 </xref>@ B and data not shown ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.117 Consistent with the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> gene expression pattern and in contrast to the human disease , we documented a marked increase in apoptosis and proliferation in murine MM samples relative to those in human MM samples ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figures 6 </xref>@ B and 6C ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.118 Such observations gain added significance in light of the observation that MCL1 maps to a region of gene amplification in aggressive human MM primary tumors and prompt speculation that MCL1 and BCL2 play critical roles in the progression of human myeloma ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4 bib19 bib25"> Carrasco et al. , 2006 ; Le Gouill et al. , 2004 ; Mitsiades et al. , 2004 </xref> ) —a theory that can now be tested in this genetic model system .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.119 <sec-title level="1"> Discussion </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.120 In this study , we provide genetic evidence and correlative human data supporting a role for the differentiation and unfolded protein @/@ ER stress response factor X box binding protein-1 spliced isoform ( XBP-1s ) in the development of MGUS and MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.121 Our molecular and phenotypic analyses of the XBP-1s @-@ driven myeloma model implicate the chronic ER stress response in MM pathogenesis .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.122 <sec-title level="2"> A Genetically Engineered Mouse Model of Human MM </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.123 In this <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic model , enforced XBP-1s expression in the B cell compartment enhances B cell proliferative potential and activates known MM @-@ relevant pathways , leading to the development of MGUS and MM disease possessing many of the molecular , cellular , and clinical features of the human condition .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.124 As in other genetically engineered mouse ( GEM ) models of human diseases , some differences do exist between the mouse and human conditions , particularly in the levels of genome instability .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.125 In addition , human MM is predominantly of IgG isotype , but <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> MGUS and MM cases are either the IgG isotype ( 50 % ) or the IgM isotype ( 50 % ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.126 Another difference is the prevalence of dermatitis and splenic plasmacytosis in the mouse that , in humans , are more commonly encountered in patients with atypical plasma @-@ cell malignancies such as the POEMS syndrome and Castleman 's disease ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7 bib32"> Dispenzieri , 2005 ; Shahidi et al. , 1995 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.127 At the same time , there are remarkable similarities between the disease phenotypes in mice and humans .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.128 These include progression from MGUS to MM accompanied by bone marrow involvement with clonal plasma cells , serum M spike , bone lytic lesions , and Ig deposition in the kidney , all classical defining features of human MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.129 Molecularly , <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> MM exhibited dysregulation of several signature MM genes and pathways .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.130 For example , expression alteration of genes such as Cyclin D1 , gp130 , and MAF parallel the dysregulation of these genes identified in human MM cells , which are variously driven by recurrent chromosomal translocations , gene amplification , and @/@ or transcriptional mechanisms and represent essential elements in the genesis and progression of human MM ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"> Kuehl and Bergsagel , 2002 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.131 The proliferation effect induced by IL-6 is mediated by the PI3K and MAPK pathways and through the activation of CEBPB .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.132 Given the known role of the CEBP family of transcription factors in carcinogenesis ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"> Sebastian and Johnson , 2006 </xref> ) , the strong overexpression of CEBPB , as well as CEBPA and CEBPD , may contribute to the strong proliferative drive of <i> Eμ-XBP-1s </i> B transgenic cells that , through the acquisition of additional genetic @/@ epigenetic lesions , could promote the development of MGUS and MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.133 Additionally , CEBPB exerts an inhibitory activity toward the AP1 complex , at both the expression and transcriptional levels ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"> Gagliardi et al. , 2003 </xref> ) , demonstrated also in a human MM cell line ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36"> Takeshita et al. , 2004 </xref> ) , that may be responsible for the low JUN and FOS levels in the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> B cells .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.134 Also , in accord with human MM , <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> MM cells exhibit overexpression of APRIL ( <i> a pr </i>@ oliferation @- @<i> i </i>@ nducing <i> l </i>@ igand ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.135 APRIL is a member of the tumor necrosis family of ligands , which also includes B lymphocyte stimulator @/@ B cell activating factor ( BlyS @/@ BAFF , which is also upregulated in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> MM cells ) , and these factors have been shown to serve essential prosurvival roles in normal and malignant B lymphocytes .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.136 Increased expression of APRIL or BlyS have been reported in various B cell malignancies , including MM ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12 bib27"> He et al. , 2004 ; Novak et al. , 2004 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.137 Taken together , these cross @-@ species multilevel comparisons , spanning from molecular to organismal levels , provide a measure of validation that the <i> Eμ-XBP-1s </i> mouse represents a relevant model of human MM , suggesting its utility in the study of pathways known or presumed to be altered in the human disease .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.138 In this regard , molecular characterization of mouse and human MM has implicated two antiapoptotic genes , MCL1 and BCL2 , in MM progression .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.139 MCL1 and BCL2 are commonly amplified and overexpressed in human MM ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4 bib19 bib35"> Carrasco et al. , 2006 ; Le Gouill et al. , 2004 ; Spets et al. , 2002 </xref> ) ; however , they were downregulated in the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> tumors ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6 </xref>@ B ) , but not in premalignant B cells .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.140 This pattern of expression is consistent with the observed increase in apoptosis in the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> mouse MM when compared to human MM samples ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6 </xref>@ D ) , suggesting that active proapoptotic mechanisms may be acting to constrain the MM phenotype in this model .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.141 Moreover , analysis of published data comparing the expression level of plasma cells from healthy donors , MGUS , and MM patients ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40"> Zhan et al. , 2002 </xref> ) indeed shows that only a subset of MM samples have significantly higher MCL1 levels than healthy donors , whereas MGUS patients and normal donors present comparable MCL1 expression ( <xref ref-type="sec" rid="app2"> Figure S3 </xref>@ B ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.142 These observations prompt speculation that MCL1 plays an especially critical role in the progression of human MM and motivate additional genetic modeling studies in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> system to formally test the role of MCL1 in MM progression .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.143 Given the relatively long latency and low penetrance in the appearance of MGUS and MM in this model , it stands to reason that additional genetic lesions and pathway dysregulations are needed to develop MGUS and MM in the <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> system .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.144 Indeed , several hallmark genes and pathways linked to MM pathogenesis are altered at the premalignant B cell level , for example Cyclin D1 , Cyclin D2 , MAF , and MAFB , providing a proliferation impetus to precursor B cells and plasma cells .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.145 However , other genes are consistently dysregulated specifically in the transition to MM , but not in <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> B cells or in the nontransgenic B cells such as BAFF , APRIL , and several genes associated in MM human studies with a high degree of proliferation and poor prognosis ( TOP2A , BIRC5 , CCNB2 , NEK2 , AURKA , BUB1 , CDC2 , and CDCA1 ; data not shown ) , suggesting that other genetic and @/@ or epigenetic additional lesions are needed to drive the progression into MGUS and furthermore into MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.146 Therefore , <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mice constitute a valuable tool for in vivo testing of genetic lesions capable of inducing MGUS and full @-@ blown MM , on the backdrop of a paraphysiological increase in plasma @-@ cell number .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.147 <sec-title level="2"> Role of XBP-1s and ER Stress Response in MM Pathogenesis </sec-title>
a3_pmid_1741_8411.148 In humans , the <i> XBP-1 </i> gene has not been implicated in MM pathogenesis because it does not reside in a region targeted from chromosomal amplification and @/@ or translocation in human MM tumors ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib4"> Bergsagel and Kuehl , 2005 ; Carrasco et al. , 2006 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.149 However , there is evidence that genes affecting <i> XBP-1 </i> processing are subject to genetic changes , potentially leading to epigenetic dysregulation of the XBP-1 network in MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.150 For example , the activating transcription factor 6α ( ATF6α ) , S1P , and S2P proteases , as well as ER transmembrane protein kinase and endoribonuclease inositol @-@ requiring enzyme-1α ( IREα ) , are all members of the proximal transducers of the mammalian UPR ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23"> Ma and Hendershot , 2001 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.151 Furthermore , it is known that XBP-1 activation @/@ overexpression is a downstream target ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"> Gass et al. , 2004 </xref> ) of the ER stress response pathway , which is perturbed in the setting of viral infections and inflammatory responses ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"> Li et al. , 2005 </xref> ) .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.152 This gains significance in light of the long suspected link between autoimmunity and @/@ or inflammation with MM ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"> Sirohi and Powles , 2006 </xref> ) as well as our genetic observations that sustained XBP-1s overexpression alone is capable of driving MM development , raising the intriguing possibility that this physiological stress response could have unwanted “ side effects ” that are of fundamental relevance to human MM pathogenesis .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.153 In particular , we speculate that the long-term survival of plasma cells and MGUS cells may require enhanced activation of XBP-1s to handle the high levels of antibody production and @/@ or environmental stresses .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.154 In this scenario , enhanced activation of XBP-1s may lead to chronic IL-6 production and activation of other MM @-@ relevant circuits , ultimately driving progression along the MGUS @-@ MM continuum .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.155 In summary , we propose <i> Eμ-xbp-1s </i> transgenic mouse as a relevant model of human MGUS and MM .
a3_pmid_1741_8411.156 Additionally , this genetic study , coupled with analysis of human samples , highlights the potential importance of XBP-1s in the pathogenesis of human MGUS and MM .
